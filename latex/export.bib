	abstract = {High latency of memory accesses is critical to the performance of shared memory multiprocessors. The technology trends indicate that this gap between processor and memory speeds is likely to increase in the future. To cope with memory latency problem two software-controlled techniques have been investigated: prefetching and remote write. Prefetching is a consumer-initiated technique which moves data close to the processor before they are actually needed by explicit execution prefetch instruction. Remote write, a producer-initiated technique moves data close to the processor estimated to be the next consumer. However these techniques can degrade the performance in the case of misprediction of future needs and/or consumers. The new method called lazy prefetching which combines good properties of prefetching and remote write techniques is presented. The experimental methodology used for performance analysis is also described},

	abstract = {Sex differences in cognition are consistently reported, men excelling in most visuospatial tasks and women in certain verbal tasks. It has been hypothesized that these sex differences in cognition results from a more bilateral pattern of language representation in women than in men. This bilateral pattern of language representation in women is thought to interfere with visuospatial functions in the right hemisphere. To test whether language representation is indeed more bilateral in the female than in the male brain, a meta-analysis was performed on studies that assessed language activity with functional imaging in healthy men and women. Effect sizes were weighted for sample size and the meta-analytic method was applied to obtain a combined effect size. Fourteen studies were included, providing data on 377 men and 442 women. Meta-analysis yielded a mean weighted effect d of 0.21 with a 95\% confidence interval of -0.05 to 0.48, indicating no significant difference in language lateralization between men and women. This implies that the putative sex difference in language lateralization may be absent at the population level, or may be observed only with some, as yet not defined, language tasks. It is therefore not likely that differences in language lateralization underlie the general sex differences in cognitive performance, and the neuronal basis for these cognitive sex differences remains elusive. 10.1093/brain/awh207},

Caveolae are known primarily for their ability to transport molecules across endothelial cells, but modern cellular techniques have dramatically extended our view of caveolae. They form a unique endocytic and exocytic compartment at the surface of most cells and are capable of importing molecules and delivering them to specific locations within the cell, exporting molecules to extracellular space, and compartmentalizing a variety of signaling activities. They are not simply an endocytic device with a peculiar membrane shape but constitute an entire membrane system with multiple functions essential for the cell. Specific diseases attack this system: Pathogens have been identified that use it as a means of gaining entrance to the cell.

	abstract = {The recently sequenced genome of the parasitic bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium contains only 468 identified protein-coding genes that have been dubbed a minimal gene complement [Fraser, C.M., Gocayne, J.D., White, O., Adams, M.D., Clayton, R.A., et al. (1995) Science 270, 397-403]. Although the M. genitalium gene complement is indeed the smallest among known cellular life forms, there is no evidence that it is the minimal self-sufficient gene set. To derive such a set, we compared the 468 predicted M. genitalium protein sequences with the 1703 protein sequences encoded by the other completely sequenced small bacterial genome, that of Haemophilus influenzae. M. genitalium and H. influenzae belong to two ancient bacterial lineages, i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Therefore, the genes that are conserved in these two bacteria are almost certainly essential for cellular function. It is this category of genes that is most likely to approximate the minimal gene set. We found that 240 M. genitalium genes have orthologs among the genes of H. influenzae. This collection of genes falls short of comprising the minimal set as some enzymes responsible for intermediate steps in essential pathways are missing. The apparent reason for this is the phenomenon that we call nonorthologous gene displacement when the same function is fulfilled by nonorthologous proteins in two organisms. We identified 22 nonorthologous displacements and supplemented the set of orthologs with the respective M. genitalium genes. After examining the resulting list of 262 genes for possible functional redundancy and for the presence of apparently parasite-specific genes, 6 genes were removed. We suggest that the remaining 256 genes are close to the minimal gene set that is necessary and sufficient to sustain the existence of a modern-type cell. Most of the proteins encoded by the genes from the minimal set have eukaryotic or archaeal homologs but seven key proteins of DNA replication do not. We speculate that the last common ancestor of the three primary kingdoms had an RNA genome. Possibilities are explored to further reduce the minimal set to model a primitive cell that might have existed at a very early stage of life evolution.},

@article{citeulike:4873163,
	abstract = {In studying the single file model in its discrete as well as in its continuum form the relationship between the phenomenological continuum theory of diffusion and the rate theory approach is analyzed. The single file model in its original form is discrete and represents the most general rate theory model for ion transport through rigid pores in biological membranes. In neglecting the interionic interactions which the single file model takes into account, the Nernst-Planck equation of macroscopic free diffusion can be derived from single file by means of the procedure n leads to infinity (where n is the number of binding sites within a pore) and the classical diffusion theory can thereby be integrated into the more general concept of single filing transport. Moreover, the single file model has been transformed in the limit n leads to infinity into the corresponding continuum form involving interionic interactions. The essential differences between the two derived continuum forms are: In the macroscopic diffusion model, the interionic interactions are regarded in the form of a "mean field". Thus we only get one equation of motion (Nernst-Planck equation) for the ionic concentration c(x, t) within the membrane. In the continuum version of the single file model, however, we obtain a hierarchy of Fokker-Planck equations for the probability density functions Pm(x1, . . . , xm, t) (where m is the number of ions within a pore). The interactions of the single file system are incorporated in detail into the Fokker-Planck equation as well as into the corresponding boundary conditions. As a consequence, the boundary conditions are highly complex in comparison with periodic conditions or Dirichlet conditions often used for the Nernst-Planck equation in electrophysiology. Two types of boundary conditions have been found which are principally different: The first one is to regulate the entry and exit of the ions at the pore mouth by a negative feedback mechanism, the second one describes the collisions of the ions within multiply occupied pores. In this context the question is discussed of whether the continuum version of single file has advantages over the discrete one.},

Drawing from theories of work motivation and public service motivation, this article examines three public-private differences that might produce different levels of work effort in the two sectors. First, government and business may offer different extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. Second, public and private workers may seek different rewards. Third, public and private workers may differ in personal characteristics that predict work effort. Using 1989 and 1998 data fromthe General Social Survey, we find that government employees reported slightly higher work effort than those in the private sector. Public- and private-sector workers differ in the value they place on extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, in the rewards their jobs offer, and in some personal characteristics. Government jobs offering interesting work and opportunities to help others, combined with the greater age of public employees, explain most of the sectoral differences in self-reported work effort. 10.1177/0275074003258823},

	abstract = {Mason, C. R., J. E. Gomez, and T. J. Ebner. Hand Synergies During Reach-to-Grasp. J. Neurophysiol. 86: 2896-2910, 2001. An emerging viewpoint is that the CNS uses synergies to simplify the control of the hand. Previous work has shown that static hand postures for mimed grasps can be described by a few principal components in which the higher order components explained only a small fraction of the variance yet provided meaningful information. Extending that earlier work, this study addressed whether the entire act of grasp can be described by a small number of postural synergies and whether these synergies are similar for different grasps. Five right-handed adults performed five types of reach-to-grasps including power grasp, power grasp with a lift, precision grasp, and mimed power grasp and mimed precision grasp of 16 different objects. The object shapes were cones, cylinders, and spindles, systematically varied in size to produce a large range of finger joint angle combinations. Three-dimensional reconstructions of 21 positions on the hand and wrist throughout the reach-to-grasp were obtained using a four-camera video system. Singular value decomposition on the temporal sequence of the marker positions was used to identify the common patterns ("eigenpostures") across the 16 objects for each task and their weightings as a function of time. The first eigenposture explained an average of 97.3 {+/-} 0.89\% (mean {+/-} SD) of the variance of the hand shape, and the second another 1.9 {+/-} 0.85\%. The first eigenposture was characterized by an open hand configuration that opens and closes during reach. The second eigenposture contributed to the control of the thumb and long fingers, particularly in the opening of the hand during the reach and the closing in preparation for object grasp. The eigenpostures and their temporal evolutions were similar across subjects and grasps. The higher order eigenpostures, although explaining only small amounts of the variance, contributed to the movements of the fingers and thumb. These findings suggest that much of reach-to-grasp is effected using a base posture with refinements in finger and thumb positions added in time to yield unique hand shapes.},

However, the particular microRNAs (miRNAs) involved are largely unknown. Here we identify specific miRNAs that function at synapses to control dendritic spine structure by performing a functional screen. One of the identified miRNAs, miR-138, is highly enriched in the brain, localized within dendrites and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines in rat hippocampal neurons. miR-138 controls the expression of acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), an enzyme regulating the palmitoylation status of proteins that are known to function at the synapse, including the alpha(13) subunits of G proteins (Galpha(13)). RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of APT1 and the expression of membrane-localized Galpha(13) both suppress spine enlargement caused by inhibition of miR-138, suggesting that APT1-regulated depalmitoylation of Galpha(13) might be an important downstream event of miR-138 function. Our results uncover a previously unknown miRNA-dependent mechanism in neurons and demonstrate a previously unrecognized complexity of miRNA-dependent control of dendritic spine morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {Here we show that the cytosine-5 methyltransferase DNMT2 controls retrotransposon silencing in Drosophila somatic cells. In Drosophila, significant DNMT2-dependent DNA methylation occurs during early embryogenesis. Suppression of white gene silencing by Mt2 (Dnmt2) null mutations in variegated P[w(+)] element insertions identified functional targets of DNMT2. The enzyme controls DNA methylation at retrotransposons in early embryos and initiates histone H4K20 trimethylation catalyzed by the SUV4-20 methyltransferase. In somatic cells, loss of DNMT2 eliminates H4K20 trimethylation at retrotransposons and impairs maintenance of retrotransposon silencing. In Dnmt2 and Suv4-20 null genotypes, retrotransposons are strongly overexpressed in somatic but not germline cells, where retrotransposon silencing depends on an RNAi mechanism. DNMT2 also controls integrity of chromosome 2R and 3R telomeres. In Dnmt2 null strains, we found stable loss of the subtelomeric clusters of defective Invader4 elements. Together, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of DNA methylation in retrotransposon silencing and telomere integrity in Drosophila.},

	abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The recent achievement of Bose–Einstein condensation of chromium atoms [1] has opened longed-for experimental access to a degenerate quantum gas with long-range and anisotropic interaction. Due to the large magnetic moment of chromium atoms of 6\&nbsp;μB, in contrast to other Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs), magnetic dipole-dipole interaction plays an important role in a chromium BEC. Many new physical properties of degenerate gases arising from these magnetic forces have been predicted in the past and can now be studied experimentally. Besides these phenomena, the large dipole moment leads to a breakdown of standard methods for the creation of a chromium BEC. Cooling and trapping methods had to be adapted to the special electronic structure of chromium to reach the regime of quantum degeneracy. Some of them apply generally to gases with large dipolar forces. We present here a detailed discussion of the experimental techniques which are used to create a chromium BEC and allow us to produce pure condensates with up to 105 atoms in an optical dipole trap. We also describe the methods used to determine the trapping parameters.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of circulating sex steroid hormones and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). METHODS: We included 260 men, 60 years old or older, who participated in Phase 1 (1988 to 1991) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and for whom surplus serum was available. We measured the serum concentrations of testosterone, androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), estradiol, and SHBG. Free testosterone was calculated from the circulating testosterone, SHBG, and albumin. The cases (n = 128) were men with two to four symptoms (nocturia, hesitancy, incomplete emptying, and weak stream), but who had never undergone noncancer prostate surgery. The controls (n = 132) were men who neither had symptoms nor had undergone noncancer prostate surgery. We adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, waist circumference, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity in logistic regression models and used sampling weights. RESULTS: The cases had statistically significantly greater AAG and estradiol concentrations than did the controls. After multivariate adjustment, the men in the top tertile of AAG (odds ratio 2.62, 95\% confidence interval 1.12 to 6.14) had a greater risk of LUTS compared with men in the bottom two tertiles. Also, men with a greater estradiol concentration (odds ratio 1.78, 95\% confidence interval 0.91 to 3.49) and a greater estradiol/SHBG molar ratio (odds ratio 2.41, 95\% confidence interval 1.39 to 4.17) had a greater risk of LUTS than did men with lower concentrations. No consistent associations were seen for circulating testosterone, free testosterone, or SHBG. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study representative of older U.S. men, circulating AAG, a metabolite of dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol were associated with an increased risk of having LUTS.},

@article{citeulike:4873012,
	abstract = {The role of gamma oscillations in producing synchronized firing of groups of principal cells is well known. Here, we argue that gamma oscillations have a second function: they select which principal cells fire. This selection process occurs through the interaction of excitation with gamma frequency feedback inhibition. We sought to understand the rules that govern this process. One possibility is that a constant fraction of cells fire. Our analysis shows, however, that the fraction is not robust because it depends on the distribution of excitation to different cells. A robust description is termed E\%-max: cells fire if they have suprathreshold excitation (E) within E\% of the cell that has maximum excitation. The value of E\%-max is approximated by the ratio of the delay of feedback inhibition to the membrane time constant. From measured values, we estimate that E\%-max is 5-15\%. Thus, an E\%-max winner-take-all process can discriminate between groups of cells that have only small differences in excitation. To test the utility of this framework, we analyzed the role of oscillations in V1, one of the few systems in which both spiking and intracellular excitation have been directly measured. We show that an E\%-max winner-take-all process provides a simple explanation for why the orientation tuning of firing is narrower than that of the excitatory input and why this difference is not affected by increasing excitation. Because gamma oscillations occur in many brain regions, the framework we have developed for understanding the second function of gamma is likely to have wide applicability.},

Virtually all transcription factor binding locations, landmarks of transcription initiation, and the resulting gene expression observed in human hepatocytes were recapitulated across the entire human chromosome 21 in the mouse hepatocyte nucleus. Thus, in homologous tissues, genetic sequence is largely responsible for directing transcriptional programs; interspecies differences in epigenetic machinery, cellular environment, and transcription factors themselves play secondary roles. 10.1126/science.1160930},

Such patterns are characteristic of mining bursts and not of nuclear explosions or earthquakes so that detecting a ripple delay structure can serve as one component for discrimination. In the frequency-domain approach, a generalization of cepstral analysis is used to derive an F statistic for detecting delay-fired events observed on an array. Detrended log-spectra are considered as realizations of stationary processes whose periodic components are frequencies, with periods proportional to delay-time differences. An F statistic is derived that is proportional to the stacked or summed cepstra and the spectrum of the stacked log-spectra. Advantages of the cepstral F statistic accrue from better resolution and the fact that statistical significance can be established for delay peaks. It is also easily incorporated into automatic detection systems. The frequency-domain approach is compared to a time-domain approach that involves searching seasonal autoregressive models with a fixed regular delay structure. Simulated array data and data from several mining explosions, measured at an array in northern Norway, are analyzed by both approaches.},

	abstract = {Grid cells in the rat medial entorhinal cortex fire (periodically) over the entire environment. These cells provide input to hippocampal granule cells whose output is characterized by one or more small place fields. We sought to understand how this input-output transformation occurs. Available information allows simulation of this process with no freely adjustable parameters. We first examined the spatial distribution of excitation in granule cells produced by the convergence of excitatory inputs from randomly chosen grid cells. Because the resulting summation depends on the number of inputs, it is necessary to use a realistic number (approximately 1200) and to take into consideration their 20-fold variation in strength. The resulting excitation maps have only modest peaks and valleys. To analyze how this excitation interacts with inhibition, we used an E\%-max (percentage of maximal suprathreshold excitation) winner-take-all rule that describes how gamma-frequency inhibition affects firing. We found that simulated granule cells have firing maps that have one or more place fields whose size and number approximates those observed experimentally. A substantial fraction of granule cells have no place fields, as observed experimentally. Because the input firing rates and synaptic properties are known, the excitatory charge into granule cells could be calculated (2-3 pC) and was found to be only somewhat larger than required to fire granule cells (1 pC). We conclude that the input-output transformation of dentate granule does not depend strongly on synaptic modification; place field formation can be understood in terms of simple summation of randomly chosen excitatory inputs, in conjunction with a winner-take-all network mechanism.},

For a sustainable future, the energy should be derived from non-fossil sources; ideally, it should also be reliable and safe, flexible in use, affordable, and limitless. This paper examines the present global use of energy in its various forms, and considers projections for the year 2020 with particular attention to the harnessing of \&\#x2018;clean\&\#x2019; and renewable forms of energy for electricity generation and road transportation. The incorporation of renewables is constrained in many instances by the variable and intermittent nature of their output. This calls for the practical application of energy-storage systems. An evaluation is made of the prospects of the candidate storage technologies \&\#x2014; pumped-hydro, flywheels, hydrogen (for use in fuel cells), batteries \&\#x2014; for application in centralized and distributed electricity supplies, and in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The discussion concludes with the developments foreseen over the next 20 years.},

	abstract = {The psychological and neurobiological processes underlying moral judgement have been the focus of many recent empirical studies. Of central interest is whether emotions play a causal role in moral judgement, and, in parallel, how emotion-related areas of the brain contribute to moral judgement. Here we show that six patients with focal bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), a brain region necessary for the normal generation of emotions and, in particular, social emotions, produce an abnormally 'utilitarian' pattern of judgements on moral dilemmas that pit compelling considerations of aggregate welfare against highly emotionally aversive behaviours (for example, having to sacrifice one person's life to save a number of other lives). In contrast, the VMPC patients' judgements were normal in other classes of moral dilemmas. These findings indicate that, for a selective set of moral dilemmas, the VMPC is critical for normal judgements of right and wrong. The findings support a necessary role for emotion in the generation of those judgements.},

Of the various resources, available now or in future, wind is presently considered in Europe to hold most promise in the next few decades for contributing a sizable part of the electrical energy; generating electricity from wind is state of the art and feeding large amounts of wind power to the electrical grid is believed by many to be unproblematic. With recent data from one of the four control areas in Germany it is discussed how a sustainable energy supply based on off-shore wind power and pumped storage, called a "wind and water"-model, might look. It turns out that such an energy scheme, while feasible in principle, would require an immense storage capacity which would be impossible to realize. Thermal generation continues to be needed, based on various energy carriers, among them biomass according to availability},

In organisms with complex life histories, predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in the larval period has been widely documented. Several models predict how organisms should alter their size at and time to metamorphosis in response to an increased risk of predation. A survey of empirical studies finds that these theoretical predictions are frequently met. However, no one model performs the best. Additionally, there are several results not predicted by any model. Predator-induced plasticity in metamorphic traits may be related to predator-induced changes in larval morphology and behavior. Predictions of predator effects on larval traits are generally met, except for direct costs of predator-induced morphological phenotypes. Future work should incorporate more detailed studies of growth rate, morphology, and behavior during the larval period, as well as studies of size-specific mortality rates in the presence and absence of predators.},

We present a crystal structure of [Fe]-hydrogenase at 1.75 angstrom resolution, showing a mononuclear iron coordinated by the sulfur of cysteine 176, two carbon monoxide (CO) molecules, and the sp2-hybridized nitrogen of a 2-pyridinol compound with back-bonding properties similar to those of cyanide. The three-dimensional arrangement of the ligands is similar to that of thiolate, CO, and cyanide ligated to the low-spin iron in binuclear [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases, although the enzymes have evolved independently and the CO and cyanide ligands are not found in any other metalloenzyme. The related iron ligation pattern of hydrogenases exemplifies convergent evolution and presumably plays an essential role in H2 activation.

	abstract = {Abstract Recent theories regarding the evolution of predator-prey interactions is reviewed. This includes theory about the dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on stability may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically structured populations promises to advance our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey interactions.},

This paper argues that activity theory provides an appropriate framework for analyzing needs, tasks, and outcomes for designing CLEs. Activity theory is a socio-cultural, socio-historical lens through which designers can analyze human activity systems. It focuses on the interaction of human activity and consciousness within its relevant environmental context. Since conscious learning emerges from activity (performance), not as a precursor to it, CLEs should attempt to replicate the activity structures, tools and sign systems, socio-cultural rules, and community expectations that performers must accommodate while acting on some object of learning. After explicating assumptions of activity theory and briefly describing the components of CLEs, this paper describes a process for using activity theory as a framework for describing the components of an activity system that can be modeled in CLEs.},

These data yield the fabric and stress tensors and the distributions of contact

a reasonable approximation, a functional relation between the system pressure,
\$P\$, and the mean contact number, \$Z\$. This relationship applies to the shear
stress \$\tau\$, except for the strains in the immediate vicinity of the contact
network reversal. By contrast, quantities such as \$P\$, \$\tau\$ and \$Z\$ are
strongly hysteretic functions of the strain, \$\epsilon\$. We find that the

Using 1\% samples of college graduates in 1983, 1993, and 2003, we find that most of women's average pay rose from 72\% to 89\% of men's, largely because women's seniority levels rose and pay differences between seemingly comparable male and female college graduates fell. Women's concentration in lower paying fields of study explains another 3\% or 4\% of the pay disparity, but women's migration into fields traditionally dominated by men has not contributed much to the narrowing of the pay gap. 10.1177/0275074008317158},

The spatial signals that direct this immediate tissue response are unknown. Owing to their fast diffusion and versatile biological activities, reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are interesting candidates for wound-to-leukocyte signalling. Here we probe the role of H2O2 during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae expressing a genetically encoded H2O2 sensor. This reporter revealed a sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting <3\&\#9;min after wounding and peaking at <20\&\#9;min, which extended <100\&\#19;200\&\#9;\&\#188;m into the tail-fin epithelium as a decreasing concentration gradient. Using pharmacological and genetic inhibition, we show that this gradient is created by dual oxidase (Duox), and that it is required for rapid recruitment of leukocytes to the wound. This is the first observation, to our knowledge, of a tissue-scale H2O2 pattern, and the first evidence that H2O2 signals to leukocytes in tissues, in addition to its known antiseptic role.},

	abstract = {APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. APRIL mRNA shows high levels of expression in tumors of different origin and a low level of expression in normal cells. APRIL shares two TNF receptor family members, TACI and BCMA, with another TNF homolog, BLyS/BAFF. BLyS is involved in regulation of B-cell activation and survival and also binds to a third receptor, BR3/BAFF-R, which is not shared with APRIL. Recombinant APRIL and BLyS induce accumulation of B cells in mice, while BLyS deficiency results in severe B-cell dysfunction. To investigate the physiological role of APRIL, we generated mice that are deficient in its encoding gene. APRIL-/- mice were viable and fertile and lacked any gross abnormality. Detailed histological analysis did not reveal any defects in major tissues and organs, including the primary and secondary immune organs. T- and B-cell development and in vitro function were normal as well, as were T-cell-dependent and -independent in vivo humoral responses to antigenic challenge. These data indicate that APRIL is dispensable in the mouse for proper development. Thus, BLyS may be capable of fulfilling APRIL's main functions. 10.1128/MCB.24.3.997-1006.2004},

	abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Rubredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (ROO) is the terminal oxidase of a soluble electron transfer chain found in Desulfovibrio gigas. This protein belongs to the flavodiiron family and was initially described as an oxygen reductase, converting this substrate to water and acting as an oxygen-detoxifying system. However, more recent studies evidenced also the ability for this protein to act as a nitric oxide reductase, suggesting an alternative physiological role. To clarify the apparent bifunctional nature of this protein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the protein, in different redox states, together with O2 and NO molecules in aqueous solution. The two small molecules were parameterized using free-energy calculations of the hydration process. With these simulations we were able to identify specific protein paths that allow the diffusion of both these molecules through the protein towards the catalytic centers. Also, we have tried to characterize the preference of ROO towards the presence of O2 and/or NO at the active site. By using free-energy simulations, we did not find any significant preference for ROO to accommodate both O2 and NO. Also, from our molecular dynamics simulations we were able to identify similar diffusion profiles for both O2 and NO molecules. These two conclusions are in good agreement with previous experimental works stating that ROO is able to catalyze both O2 and NO.},

At low rotation rates, steady motion is found where the balls adopt stable equilibrium positions rotating adjacent to the rising wall at a speed which is in agreement with available theory. At higher cylinder speeds time-dependent motion sets in via Hopf bifurcations, and when one or two balls are present the motion is strictly periodic.

	abstract = {Until recently, a steadily rising clock rate and other uniprocessor micro architectural improvements could be relied upon to consistently deliver increasing performance for a wide range of applications. Current difficulties in maintaining this trend have lead microprocessor manufacturers to add value by incorporating multiple processors on a chip. Unfortunately, since decades of compiler research have not succeeded in delivering automatic threading for prevalent code properties, this approach demonstrates no improvement for a large class of existing codes. To find useful work for chip multiprocessors, we propose an automatic approach to thread extraction, called decoupled software pipelining (DSWP). DSWP exploits the finegrained pipeline parallelism lurking in most applications to extract long-running, concurrently executing threads. Use of the nonspeculative and truly decoupled threads produced by DSWP can increase execution efficiency and provide significant latency tolerance, mitigating design complexity by reducing intercore communication and per-core resource requirements. Using our initial fully automatic compiler implementation and a validated processor model, we prove the concept by demonstrating significant gains for dual-core chip multiprocessor models running a variety of codes. We then explore simple opportunities missed by our initial compiler implementation which suggest a promising future for this approach.},

As observed in several limit studies, most of the parallelization opportunities require looking for parallelism beyond local regions of code. To exploit these opportunities, especially for sequential applications, researchers have recently proposed global multi-threaded instruction scheduling techniques, including DSWP and GREMIO. These techniques simultaneously schedule instructions from large regions of code, such as arbitrary loop nests or whole procedures, and have been shown to be effective at extracting threads for many applications. A key enabler of these global instruction scheduling techniques is the Multi-Threaded Code Generation (MTCG) algorithm proposed in [16], which generates multi-threaded code for any partition of the instructions into threads. This algorithm inserts communication and synchronization instructions in order to satisfy all inter-thread dependences.},

	abstract = {Exercise studies have suggested that the presence of carbohydrate in the human mouth activates regions of the brain that can enhance exercise performance but direct evidence of such a mechanism is limited. The first aim of the present study was to observe how rinsing the mouth with solutions containing glucose and maltodextrin, disguised with artificial sweetener, would affect exercise performance. The second aim was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the brain regions activated by these substances. In Study 1A, eight endurance-trained cyclists (Graphic 60.8 ± 4.1 ml kg−1 min−1) completed a cycle time trial (total work = 914 ± 29 kJ) significantly faster when rinsing their mouths with a 6.4\% glucose solution compared with a placebo containing saccharin (60.4 ± 3.7 and 61.6 ± 3.8 min, respectively, P = 0.007). The corresponding fMRI study (Study 1B) revealed that oral exposure to glucose activated reward-related brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex and striatum, which were unresponsive to saccharin. In Study 2A, eight endurance-trained cyclists (Graphic 57.8 ± 3.2 ml kg−1 min−1) tested the effect of rinsing with a 6.4\% maltodextrin solution on exercise performance, showing it to significantly reduce the time to complete the cycle time trial (total work = 837 ± 68 kJ) compared to an artificially sweetened placebo (62.6 ± 4.7 and 64.6 ± 4.9 min, respectively, P = 0.012). The second neuroimaging study (Study 2B) compared the cortical response to oral maltodextrin and glucose, revealing a similar pattern of brain activation in response to the two carbohydrate solutions, including areas of the insula/frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. The results suggest that the improvement in exercise performance that is observed when carbohydrate is present in the mouth may be due to the activation of brain regions believed to be involved in reward and motor control. The findings also suggest that there may be a class of so far unidentified oral receptors that respond to carbohydrate independently of those for sweetness.},

	abstract = {Convergent scheduling is a general framework for cluster assignment and instruction scheduling on spatial architectures. A convergent scheduler is composed of independent passes, each implementing a heuristic that addresses a particular problem or constraint. The passes share a simple, common interface that provides spatial and temporal preference for each instruction. Preferences are not absolute; instead, the interface allows a pass to express the confidence of its preferences, as well as preferences for multiple space and time slots. A pass operates by modifying these preferences. By applying a series of passes that address all the relevant constraints, the convergent scheduler can produce a schedule that satisfies all the important constraints. Because all passes are independent and need to understand only one interface to interact with each other, convergent scheduling simplifies the problem of handling multiple constraints and codeveloping different heuristics. We have applied convergent scheduling to two spatial architectures: the Raw processor and a clustered VLIW machine. It is able to successfully handle traditional constraints such as parallelism, load balancing, and communication minimization, as well as constraints due to preplaced instructions, which are instructions with predetermined cluster assignment. Convergent scheduling is able to obtain an average performance improvement of 21\% over the existing space-time scheduler of the Raw processor, and an improvement of 14\% over state-of-the-art assignment and scheduling techniques on a clustered VLIW architecture.},

@article{citeulike:4872879,
	abstract = {Sex differences in parasite infection rates, intensities, or population patterns are common in a wide range of taxa. These differences are usually attributed to 1 of 2 causes: (1) ecological (sociological in humans); and (2) physiological, usually hormonal in origin. Examples of the first cause include differential exposure to pathogens because of sex-specific behavior or morphology. The second cause may stem from the well-documented association between testosterone and the immune system; sexually mature male vertebrates are often more susceptible to infection and carry higher parasite burdens in the field. Although many researchers favor one explanation over the other, the requisite controlled experiments to rule out confounding variables are often neglected. We suggest that sex differences in disease have evolved just as sex differences in morphology and behavior, and are the result of selection acting differently on males and females. Research has often focused on proximate mechanistic explanations for the sex difference in infection rates, but it is equally important to understand the generality of the patterns in an evolutionary context. Because males potentially gain more than females by taking risks and engaging in competition, sexual selection pressure has shaped male behavior and appearance to maximize competitive ability and attractiveness. Many of the classic male attributes such as antlers on deer are testosterone-dependent, putting males in what appears to be a cruel bind: become vulnerable to disease by developing an attractive secondary sexual ornament, or risk lowered mating success by reducing it. A variety of hypotheses have been put forward to explain why males have not circumvented this dilemma. The mating system of the host species will influence the likelihood of sex differences in parasite infection, because males in monogamous species are subject to weaker sexual selection than males in polygynous species. Whether these evolutionary generalizations apply to invertebrates, which lack testosterone, remains to be seen.},

	abstract = {Amid ongoing public speculation about the reasons for sex differences in careers in science and mathematics, we present a consensus statement that is based on the best available scientific evidence. Sex differences in science and math achievement and ability are smaller for the mid-range of the abilities distribution than they are for those with the highest levels of achievement and ability. Males are more variable on most measures of quantitative and visuospatial ability, which necessarily results in more males at both high- and low-ability extremes; the reasons why males are often more variable remain elusive. Successful careers in math and science require many types of cognitive abilities. Females tend to excel in verbal abilities, with large differences between females and males found when assessments include writing samples. High-level achievement in science and math requires the ability to communicate effectively and comprehend abstract ideas, so the female advantage in writing should be helpful in all academic domains. Males outperform females on most measures of visuospatial abilities, which have been implicated as contributing to sex differences on standardized exams in mathematics and science. An evolutionary account of sex differences in mathematics and science supports the conclusion that, although sex differences in math and science performance have not directly evolved, they could be indirectly related to differences in interests and specific brain and cognitive systems. We review the brain basis for sex differences in science and mathematics, describe consistent effects, and identify numerous possible correlates. Experience alters brain structures and functioning, so causal statements about brain differences and success in math and science are circular. A wide range of sociocultural forces contribute to sex differences in mathematics and science achievement and ability—including the effects of family, neighborhood, peer, and school influences; training and experience; and cultural practices. We conclude that early experience, biological factors, educational policy, and cultural context affect the number of women and men who pursue advanced study in science and math and that these effects add and interact in complex ways. There are no single or simple answers to the complex questions about sex differences in science and mathematics.},

A Raw microprocessor distributes all of its resources, including instruction streams, register files, memory ports, and ALUs, over a pipelined two-dimensional mesh interconnect, and exposes them fully to the compiler. Because communication in Raw machines is distributed, compiling for instruction-level parallelism (ILP) requires both spatial instruction partitioning as well as traditional temporal instruction scheduling. In addition, the compiler must explicitly manage all communication through the interconnect, including the global synchronization required at branch points. This paper describes RAWCC, the compiler we have developed for compiling general-purpose sequential programs to the distributed Raw architecture.

	abstract = {The bypass paths and multiported register files in microprocessors serve as an implicit interconnect to communicate operand values among pipeline stages and multiple ALUs. Previous superscalar designs implemented this interconnect using centralized structures that do not scale with increasing ILP demands. In search of scalability, recent microprocessor designs in industry and academia exhibit a trend toward distributed resources such as partitioned register files, banked caches, multiple independent compute pipelines, and even multiple program counters. Some of these partitioned microprocessor designs have begun to implement bypassing and operand transport using point-to-point interconnects. We call interconnects optimized for scalar data transport, whether centralized or distributed, scalar operand networks. Although these networks share many of the challenges of multiprocessor networks such as scalability and deadlock avoidance, they have many unique requirements, including ultra-low latency (a few cycles versus tens of cycles) and ultra-fast operation-operand matching. This paper discusses the unique properties of scalar operand networks (SONs), examines alternative ways of implementing them, and introduces the AsTrO taxonomy to distinguish between them. It discusses the design of two alternative networks in the context of the Raw microprocessor, and presents timing, area, and energy statistics for a real implementation. The paper also presents a 5-tuple performance model for SONs and analyzes their performance sensitivity to network properties for ILP workloads.},

Raw supports both ILP and streams by routingoperands between architecturally-exposed functional units overa point-to-point scalar operand network. This network offers lowlatency for scalar data transport. Raw manages the effect of wiredelays by exposing the interconnect and using software to orchestrateboth scalar and stream data transport.We have implemented a prototype Raw microprocessor in IBM's180 nm, 6-layer copper, CMOS 7SF standard-cell ASIC process. Wehave also implemented ILP and stream compilers. Our evaluationattempts to determine the extent to which Raw succeeds in meetingits goal of serving as a more versatile, general-purpose processor.Central to achieving this goal is Raw's ability to exploit all formsof parallelism, including ILP, DLP, TLP, and Stream parallelism.Specifically, we evaluate the performance of Raw on a diverse setof codes including traditional sequential programs, streaming applications,server workloads and bit-level embedded computation.Our experimental methodology makes use of a cycle-accurate simulatorvalidated against our real hardware. Compared to a 180 nmPentium-III, using commodity PC memory system components, Rawperforms within a factor of 2x for sequential applications with a verylow degree of ILP, about 2x to 9x better for higher levels of ILP, and10x-100x better when highly parallel applications are coded in astream language or optimized by hand. The paper also proposes anew versatility metric and uses it to discuss the generality of Raw.},

	abstract = {This paper describes Maps, a compiler managed memory system for Raw architectures. Traditional processors for sequential programs maintain the abstraction of a unified memory by using a single centralized memory system. This implementation leads to the infamous "Von Neumann bottleneck," with machine performance limited by the large memory latency and limited memory bandwidth. A Raw architecture addresses this problem by taking advantage of the rapidly increasing transistor budget to move much of its memory on chip. To remove the bottleneck and complexity associated with centralized memory, Raw distributes the memory with its processing elements. Unified memory semantics are implemented jointly by the hardware and the compiler. The hardware provides a clean compiler interface to its two inter-tile interconnects: a fast, statically schedulable network and a traditional dynamic network. Maps then uses these communication mechanisms to orchestrate the memory accesses for low latency and parallelism while enforcing proper dependence. It optimizes for speed in two ways: by finding accesses that can be scheduled on the static interconnect through  static promotion,  and by minimizing dependence sequentialization for the remaining accesses. Static promotion is performed using  equivalence class unification  and  modulo unrolling;  memory dependences are enforced through explicit synchronization and  software serial ordering.  We have implemented Maps based on the SUIF infrastructure. This paper demonstrates that the exclusive use of static promotion yields roughly 20-fold speedup on 32 tiles for our regular applications and about 5-fold speedup on 16 or more tiles for our irregular applications. The paper also shows that selective use of dynamic accesses can be a useful complement to the mostly static memory system.},

Altered expression of TNF family members is often associated with pathological conditions such as autoimmune disease and cancer. The TNF-like ligand APRIL (A PRoliferation Inducing Ligand), first described in 1998, was named for its capacity to stimulate tumour cell proliferation in vitro. APRIL expression was initially reported in haematopoietic cells in physiological conditions, and it is overexpressed in certain tumour tissues. APRIL is now known to be involved in activation and immune responses of B cells, as well as in B cell malignancies.

In the presence of H 2  and an electron acceptor (turnover conditions), NO acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor vs. methylene blue ( K i  = 12 μM). There is no element of competition between NO and H 2 , implying that the site of NO action is not the H 2 -activating site of the hydrogenase. When the membrane-associated hydrogenase is incubated under non-turnover conditions, the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated by NO in a time-dependent process. The inactivation is a non-saturable, pseudo-first-order process which is consistent with a direct chemical reaction between NO and the hydrogenase. Kinetic evidence is presented which is compatible with an interaction between NO and a redox-active component other than the H 2 -activating site on the enzyme. The complex inhibition pattern of NO has been interpreted in terms of two distinct interactions of NO with iron-sulfur centers of the hydrogenase.},

	abstract = {Modern compilers must expose sufficient amounts of Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) to achieve the promised performance increases of superscalar and VLIW processors. One of the major impediments to achieving this goal has been inefficient programmatic control flow. Historically, the compiler has translated the programmer's original control structure directly into assembly code with conditional branch instructions. Eliminating inefficiencies in handling branch instructions and exploiting ILP has been the subject of much research. However, traditional branch handling techniques cannot significantly alter the program's inherent control structure. The advent of predication as a program control representation has enabled compilers to manipulate control in a form more closely related to the underlying program logic. This work takes full advantage of the predication paradigm by abstracting the program control flow into a logical form referred to as a  program decision logic network.  This network is modeled as a Boolean equation and minimized using modified versions of logic synthesis techniques. After minimization, the more efficient version of the program's original control flow is re-expressed in predicated code. Furthermore, this paper proposes extensions to the HPL PlayDoh predication model in support of more effective predicate decision logic network minimization. Finally, this paper shows the ability of the mechanisms presented to overcome limits on ILP previously imposed by rigid program control structure.},

	abstract = {It has recently been suggested that lycra garments are helpful for children with cerebral palsy (CP). Twelve children, with athetosis, ataxia, and spasticity, were fitted with lycra garments (Kendall-Camp UK Ltd). Scores on the Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) scales were determined before and after wearing the garment for at least 6 hours a day for 6 weeks. Five children with motor problems representative of the whole group were investigated during a reach-and-grasp task by kinematic motion analysis; reflective markers were used with and without the garment. Carers were given a questionnaire concerning the practicalities of using the garments. All 12 children made improvements in at least one of the functional scales of the PEDI, and scores for the whole group showed significant gains (Wilcoxon \&chi;2 test, self-help p\&lt;0.01; mobility p\&lt;0.5; social p\&lt;0.1). These changes were usually slight, although noticed by carers. Six children made gains of at least one scale of the caregiver assistance scores, two of the children showed losses (due to difficulties removing the garment for toileting), and four showed no change. Motion analysis indicated that (1) two children with athetosis had improved proximal stability in sitting and in smoothness of arm movements, (2) one child with ataxia had improved in proximal and distal stability, and (3) two children with spasticity had more jerky movements, although one improved in proximal stability. All children had problems in wearing the garments, including problems with toileting and incontinence of urine; the parents of only one child wanted to continue using it. Results suggest that the functional benefit of lycra garments for children with CP is mainly due to improvements in proximal stability but this should be weighed against the inconvenience and loss of independence.},

	abstract = {The effects of NO on the H2-oxidizing and diaphorase activities of the soluble hydrogenase from Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 were investigated. With fully activated enzyme, NO (8-150 nM in solution) inhibited H2 oxidation in a time- and NO-concentration-dependent process. Neither H2 nor NAD+ appeared to protect the enzyme against the inhibition. Loss of activity in the absence of an electron acceptor was about 10 times slower than under turnover conditions. The inhibition was partially reversible; approx. 50\% of full activity was recoverable after removal of the NO. Recovery was slower in the absence of an electron acceptor than in the presence of H2 plus an electron acceptor. The diaphorase activity of the unactivated hydrogenase was not affected by NO concentrations of up to 200 microM in solution. Exposure of the unactivated hydrogenase to NO irreversibly inhibited the ability of the enzyme to be fully activated for H2-oxidizing activity. The enzyme also lost its ability to respond to H2 during activation in the presence of NADH. The results are interpreted in terms of a complex inhibition that displays elements of (1) a reversible slow-binding inhibition of H2-oxidizing activity, (2) an irreversible effect on H2-oxidizing activity and (30 an irreversible inhibition of a regulatory component of the enzyme.

These basic tenets lead to the conclusion that substantial discursive change, rather than being necessitated by an extradiscursive reality, is spurred by <i>commognitive conflict</i>, that is, by the situation that arises whenever different interlocutors are acting according to differing discursive rules. The framework is applied in 2 studies, one of them featuring a class learning about negative numbers and the other focusing on 2 first graders learning about triangles and quadrilaterals. In both cases, the analysis of data is guided by questions about (a) features of the new mathematical discourse that set it apart from the mathematical discourse in which the students were conversant when the learning began; (b) students' and teachers' efforts toward the necessary discursive transformation; and (c) effects of the learningteaching process, that is, the extent of discursive change actually resulting from these efforts. One of the claims corroborated by the findings is that school learning requires an active lead of an experienced interlocutor and needs to be fueled by a learning-teaching agreement between the interlocutor and the learners.},

	abstract = {Chip multiprocessors with multiple simpler cores are gaining popularity because they have the potential to drive future performance gains without exacerbating the problems of power dissipation and complexity. Current chip multiprocessors increase throughput by utilizing multiple cores to perform computation in parallel. These designs provide real benefits for server-class applications that are explicitly multi-threaded. However, for desktop and other systems where single-thread applications dominate, multicore systems have yet to offer much benefit. Chip multiprocessors are most efficient at executing coarse-grain threads that have little communication. However, general-purpose applications do not provide many opportunities for identifying such threads, due to frequent use of pointers, recursive data structures, if-then-else branches, small function bodies, and loops with small trip counts. To attack this mismatch, this paper proposes a multicore architecture, referred to as Voltron, that extends traditional multicore systems in two ways. First, it provides a dual-mode scalar operand network to enable efficient inter-core communication and lightweight synchro synchronization. Second, Voltron can organize the cores for execution in either coupled or decoupled mode. In coupled mode, the cores execute multiple instruction streams in lock-step to collectively function as a wide-issue VLIW. In decoupled mode, the cores execute a set of fine-grain communicating threads extracted by the compiler. This paper describes the Voltron architecture and associated compiler support for orchestrating bi-modal execution.},

Age at diagnosis ranged from 19 to 62 (median 34) years and male to female ratio was 10:6. Most presented with headache or seizure, and the mean duration of symptoms was 12.8 months. A poorly defined diffuse high signal intensity lesion, extending in T2-weighted images for two lobes or more, was the characteristic magnetic resonance (MR) image finding. On postcontrast T1-weighted MR imaging, focal enhancement of the lesion was detected in five cases. All patients underwent histological confirmation by craniotomy (9 cases) or stereotactic biopsy (7 cases). Histologically, all patients had compatible findings of gliomatosis cerebri which are the widespread infiltration of neoplastic glial cells with minimal destruction of pre-existing structures.  After histological diagnosis, external radiation therapy was begun except in one case, who declined this treatment. Fourteen patients completed the whole procedure and received the planned dose (mean 5780 cGy). Median survival time after diagnosis was 38.4 months. In univariate analysis, the Ki-67 labelling index (\&gt;1) showed significant correlation with the length of survival (p=0.006).  It is suggested that 1) gliomatosis cerebri can be diagnosed by a combination of MR imaging findings and histological examination; 2) histological diagnosis and external radiation therapy might be a good treatment modality; 3) the Ki-67 labelling index correlates significantly with survival time.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Radio (SDR) is an emerging embedded domain where the physical layer of wireless protocols is implemented in software rather than the traditional application specific hardware. The operation throughput requirements of current third-generation (3G) wireless protocols are an order of magnitude higher than the capabilities of modern DSP processors. Due to this steep performance requirement, heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip designs have been proposed to support SDR. Given the difficulty in compiling traditional digital signal processors, these new multiprocessor architectures provide even greater challenges for the programmers and compilers. In this paper, we utilize a hierarchical dataflow programming model, referred to as SPIR, that is designed for modeling SDR applications. We then present a coarse-grained data ow compilation strategy that assigns a SDR protocol's DSP kernels onto multiple processors, allocates memory buffers, and determines an execution schedule that meets a prescribed throughput. Unlike traditional approaches, coarse-grained compilation exploits task-level parallelism by scheduling concurrent DSP kernels instead of instructions. Because of the streaming nature of SDR protocols, we adapted an existing instruction-level software pipelining technique, modulo scheduling, for coarse-grained compilation. Our compilation methodology is able to generate parallel code that achieves near linear speedup on a SDR multiprocessor system.},

	abstract = {While multicore hardware has become ubiquitous, explicitly parallel programming models and compiler techniques for exploiting parallelism on these systems have noticeably lagged behind. Stream programming is one model that has wide applicability in the multimedia, graphics, and signal processing domains. Streaming models execute as a set of independent actors that explicitly communicate data through channels. This paper presents a compiler technique for planning and orchestrating the execution of streaming applications on multicore platforms. An integrated unfolding and partitioning step based on integer linear programming is presented that unfolds data parallel actors as needed and maximally packs actors onto cores. Next, the actors are assigned to pipeline stages in such a way that all communication is maximally overlapped with computation on the cores. To facilitate experimentation, a generalized code generation template for mapping the software pipeline onto the Cell architecture is presented. For a range of streaming applications, a geometric mean speedup of 14.7x is achieved on a 16-core Cell platform compared to a single core.},

Ten cases of GC are presented, followed by discussions of its radiological and pathological characteristics. The diagnosis of GC was formerly made only at autopsy. However, recent improvements in imaging and biopsy now allow for antemortem diagnosis. Immunocytochemistry for S-100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in three open biopsies of early primary GC revealed diffuse proliferation of S-100 immunoreactive and GFAP-resistant small astrocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be the imaging modality of choice. T2-weighted images generally show contiguous high intensity signal in affected areas. Biopsy, either open or stereotactic, remains necessary for antemortem diagnosis. No treatment has proven effective for GC, the prognosis being poor.

	abstract = {Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) present an appealing hardware platform by providing the potential for high computation throughput, scalability, low cost, and energy efficiency. CGRAs consist of an array of function units and register files often organized as a two dimensional grid. The most difficult challenge in deploying CGRAs is compiler scheduling technology that can efficiently map software implementations of compute intensive loops onto the array. Traditional schedulers focus on the placement of operations in time and space. With CGRAs, the challenge of placement is compounded by the need to explicitly route operands from producers to consumers. To systematically attack this problem, we take an edge-centric approach to modulo scheduling that focuses on the routing problem as its primary objective. With edge-centric modulo scheduling (EMS), placement is a by-product of the routing process, and the schedule is developed by routing each edge in the dataflow graph. Routing cost metrics provide the scheduler with a global perspective to guide selection. Experiments on a wide variety of compute-intensive loops from the multimedia domain show that EMS improves throughput by 25\% over traditional iterative modulo scheduling, and achieves 98\% of the throughput of simulated annealing techniques at a fraction of the compilation time.},

	abstract = {The recent design shift towards multicore processors has spawned a significant amount of research in the area of program paralleliza- tion. The future abundance of cores on a single chip requires pro- grammer and compiler intervention to increase the amount of par- allel work possible. Much of the recent work has fallen into the areas of coarse-grain parallelization: new programming models and different ways to exploit threads and data-level parallelism. This work focuses on a complementary direction, improving per- formance through automated fine-grain parallelization. The main difficulty in achieving a performance benefit from fine-grain paral- lelism is the distribution of data memory accesses across the data caches of each core. Poor choices in the placement of data ac- cesses can lead to increased memory stalls and low resource utiliza- tion. We propose a profile-guided method for partitioning mem- ory accesses across distributed data caches. First, a profile deter- mines affinity relationships between memory accesses and work- ing set characteristics of individual memory operations in the pro- gram. Next, a program-level partitioning of the memory opera- tions is performed to divide the memory accesses across the data caches. As a result, the data accesses are proactively dispersed to reduce memory stalls and improve computation parallelization. A final detailed partitioning of the computation instructions is per- formed with knowledge of the cache location of their associated data. Overall, our data partitioning reduces stall cycles by up to 51\% versus data-incognizant partitioning, and has an overall speedup average of 30\% over a single core processor.},

We use daily data from the AR4 to calculate the mean of these three quantities, but we also derive probability density functions (PDFs) for each variable. We quantify the skill of each climate model to simulate the probability density function as a basis of assessing those models with significant capacity over the basin. We show that Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Insitut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), and MIROC-m capture the observed PDFs of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation relatively well. Other models capture one or two of these variables well but show limitations, or could not be assessed, in a third. We, therefore, recommend these three models to users of model results, but note that this recommendation is limited to this basin. However, our methodology provides quite a straightforward and quantitatively based means to choose climate models for impact assessment in any data-rich region. Specifically, we note that to demonstrate skill in simulating the daily derived PDFs is far more challenging than just simulating the mean (as a model can simulate the mean well by averaging large biases of opposite sign). Our method therefore provides a more robust foundation for using a model in impacts assessment. Copyright {\copyright} 2007 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {The May 18, 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption perturbed the atmosphere and generated atmosphere-to-ground coupled airwaves, which were recorded on at least 35 seismometers operated by the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network (PNSN). From 102 distinct travel time picks we identify coherent airwaves crossing Washington State primarily to the north and east of the volcano. The travel time curves provide evidence for both stratospheric refractions (at 200 to 300 km from the volcano) as well as probable thermospheric refractions (at 100 to 350 km). The very few first-hand reports of audible volcano sounds within about 80 km of the volcano coincide with a general absence of ground-coupled acoustic arrivals registered within about 100 km and are attributed to upward refraction of sound waves. From the coherent refracted airwave arrivals, we identify at least four distinct sources which we infer to originate 10 s, 114 s,   180 s and 319 s after the onset of an 8:32:11 PDT landslide. The first of these sources is attributed to resultant depressurization and explosion of the cryptodome. Most of the subsequent arrivals also appear to be coincident with a source located at or near the presumed volcanic conduit, but at least one of the later arrivals suggests an epicenter displaced about 9 km to the northwest of the vent. This dislocation is compatible with the direction of the sector collapse and lateral blast. We speculate that this concussion corresponds to a northern explosion event associated with hot cryptodome entering the Toutle River Valley.},

	abstract = {Objective: Shoulder subluxation is a well-known sequela of stroke. This study quantitatively compares the reduction of shoulder subluxation using four supports: the single-strap hemisling, the Bobath roll, the Rolyan humeral cuff sling, and the Cavalier support. Design/Setting: Anteroposterior shoulder radiographs of 20 consecutive first-time stroke survivors in a freestanding rehabilitation hospital were taken within 6 weeks of stroke onset. Vertical, horizontal, and total asymmetries of glenohumeral subluxation compared with the unaffected shoulders were measured before and after fitting of each support. Main Outcome Measures: Group means were compared to find which supports altered subluxation asymmetries and approximated the unaffected shoulder. Individual data were tallied to detect how often each support best reduced subluxation asymmetries. Results: The single-strap hemisling eliminated the vertical asymmetry of subluxation over the entire study group, but each support corrected the vertical asymmetry best in some subjects (55\%, 20\%, 40\%, and 5\%, respectively). The Bobath roll and the Cavalier support produced lateral displacements of the humeral head of the affected shoulder (p = 0.005, 0.004, respectively). The Rolyan humeral cuff sling significantly reduced total subluxation asymmetry (p = 0.008), whereas the single-strap hemisling, Bobath roll, and Cavalier support did not alter total asymmetry (p = 0.091, 0.283, 0.502, respectively). Conclusion: When treating shoulder subluxation, several different types of supports should be evaluated to optimize the function of the affected extremity and the reduction of the shoulder subluxation.},

	abstract = {Although the human hand has a complex structure with many individual degrees of freedom, joint movements are correlated. Studies involving simple tasks (grasping) or skilled tasks (typing or finger spelling) have shown that a small number of combined joint motions (i.e., synergies) can account for most of the variance in observed hand postures. However, those paradigms evoked a limited set of hand postures and as such the reported correlation patterns of joint motions may be task-specific. Here, we used an unconstrained haptic exploration task to evoke a set of hand postures that is representative of most naturalistic postures during object manipulation. Principal component analysis on this set revealed that the first seven principal components capture >90\% of the observed variance in hand postures. Further, we identified nine eigenvectors (or synergies) that are remarkably similar across multiple subjects and across manipulations of different sets of objects within a subject. We then determined that these synergies are used broadly by showing that they account for the changes in hand postures during other tasks. These include hand motions such as reach and grasp of objects that vary in width, curvature and angle, and skilled motions such as precision pinch. Our results demonstrate that the synergies reported here generalize across tasks, and suggest that they represent basic building blocks underlying natural human hand motions. 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4512-07.2008},

	abstract = {One of the most troublesome complications in the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients is inferior subluxation of the glenohumeral joint. The purpose of this study was to determine which of two shoulder supports, the Bobath shoulder roll or the Henderson shoulder ring, would be more effective in the management of hemiplegic patients with a subluxated glenohumeral joint. To determine the degree of subluxation and the amount of reduction after application of a shoulder support, radiographs were taken of 26 hemiplegic patients with subluxated shoulders. Radiographs of the unsupported affected shoulder were compared with radiographs of the same shoulder with each support applied. Radiographs of the unaffected shoulder were used as a comparison in determining the amount of subluxation. An analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in the reduction of inferior subluxation between the two types of shoulder support. A significant difference in subluxation, however, existed between measurements of the unsupported affected shoulder and the unaffected shoulder (p < .001) and between measurements of the unsupported affected shoulder and the supported affected shoulder (p < .001). The results of this study demonstrate the benefits of the Bobath shoulder roll and the Henderson shoulder ring in the management of hemiplegic patients with subluxated shoulders.},

	abstract = {The Wells, Nevada, earthquake of February 21, 2008, generated a complex seismo-acoustic wavefield. Epicentral infrasound was
                        recorded at 5 seismo-acoustic arrays in Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. In addition to epicentral infrasound, the earthquake triggered
                        a secondary source of infrasound at the BGU array in Utah, which was also triggered by subsequent aftershocks. By applying
                        simple constraints on the propagation of seismic and infrasound waves, we show that the secondary source is an isolated peak
                        ('Floating Island') that appears to efficiently generate infrasound through the interaction with seismic surface waves. This
                        hypothesized source location is broadly consistent with crosswind directions extracted from the Ground-to-Space (G2S) atmospheric
                        model (for the appropriate time and source/receiver locations), although modeling the propagation of infrasound predicts this
                        source location to be within the so-called 'zone-of-silence'. In contrast to epicentral infrasound, secondary infrasound associated
                        with the Wells, Nevada, earthquake sequence appears to be local to each array (i.e., not observed at multiple arrays). Secondary
                        infrasonic arrivals observed at BGU are much higher in amplitude than epicentral arrivals, highlighting the importance of
                        being able to clearly identify and separate epicentral and secondary arrivals for infrasonic event discrimination.

Some unsolved problems are considered. In particular, because Jones complex
formalism has close relation to spinor objects of the Lorentz group, within the
field of the light polarization we could have physical realizations on the
optical desk of some subtle topological distinctions between orthogonal
L\_{+}^{\uparrow} = SO\_{0}(3.1) and spinor SL(2.C) groups. These topological
differences of the groups find their corollaries in the problem of the

@article{citeulike:4870494,
	abstract = {We review connections between phase transitions in high-dimensional
combinatorial geometry and phase transitions occurring in modern
high-dimensional data analysis and signal processing. In data analysis, such
transitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection, robust data
fitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the complexity of the model
or the number of outliers increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial
geometry these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face
counts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in
these very different problems appear in the same critical locations after
appropriate calibration of variables.


These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling,
they place hard limits on the degree to which the now-ubiquitous
high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place
hard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate
outliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp
boundary of the undersampling/sparsity tradeoff in undersampling theorems.


Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume
the underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed (iid)
Gaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is
not required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal
inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are
{\it universal} across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. The experimental
results are consistent with an asymptotic large-\$n\$ universality across matrix
ensembles; finite-sample universality can be rejected.},

However, most studies of plaids used brief presentations and a 2AFC between the two interpretations, thus overlooking the dynamical aspect of plaid perception. In other domains, most notably binocular rivalry, it was shown that the dynamics of the bi-stable alternations reveal important insights about the underlying mechanisms. Here we develop methods to study the dynamics of plaid perception. Observers continually indicated their percept (coherency or transparency) during presentations that lasted 1–5 min. Two measures of the relative strength of the coherency percept were derived from those data:  C /[ C + T ], the relative time spent seeing coherency, and RTtransp, the response time to report transparency. Those measures are independent of each other yet tightly correlated, and both show systematic relations to manipulations of plaid parameters. Furthermore, the two measures are sensitive to manipulations in wide parametric regimes, including ranges where brief-presentation methods suffer from  ” ceiling” and  ” floor” effects. We conclude that studying the dynamics of bi-stability in plaids can provide new and unsuspected findings about motion integration and segmentation.},

Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249.

TLRs recognize a wide variety of microbial components and potential host-derived agonists that have emerged as key mediators of innate immunity. TLR signaling also plays an important role in the activation of the adaptive immune system by inducing proinflammatory cytokines and upregulating costimulatory molecules of antigen presenting cells. The dysregulation of TLR signaling may cause autoimmunity. This review discusses the contribution of TLR signaling to the initiation and progression of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes, obesity, and experimental autoimmune uveitis as well as aging. The involvement of TLR signaling in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases may provide novel targets for the development of therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Genetic diagnosis of an inherited disease or cancer often involves analysis for unknown point mutations in several genes; therefore, rapid and automated techniques that can process a large number of samples are needed. We describe a method for high-throughput single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis using automated capillary electrophoresis. The operating temperature of a commercially available capillary electrophoresis instrument (ABI PRISM 310) was expanded by installation of a cheap in-house designed cooling system, thereby allowing us to perform automated SSCP analysis at 14-45°C. We have used the method for detection of point mutations associated with the inherited cardiac disorders long QT syndrome (LQTS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The sensitivity of the method was 100\% when 34 different point mutations were analyzed, including two previously unpublished LQTS-associated mutations (F157C in  and G572R in), as well as eight novel normal variants in and . The analyzed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments ranged in size from 166 to 1,223 bp. Seventeen different sequence contexts were analyzed. Three different electrophoresis temperatures were used to obtain 100\% sensitivity. Two mutants could not be detected at temperatures greater than 20°C. The method has a high resolution and good reproducibility and is very robust, making multiplex SSCP analysis and pattern-based identification of known allelic variants as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) possible. These possibilities, combined with automation and short analysis time, make the method suitable for high-throughput tasks, such as genetic screening.

Displacing the dots by half their inter-column spacing produced vivid apparent motion that could be perceived in either the preferred or anti-preferred direction for each neuron. Many neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) responded more strongly on trials in which the animals reported perceiving the neurons' preferred direction, independent of the hand movement used to report their percept. This selectivity was less common in the medial superior temporal area (MST) and virtually absent in the middle temporal area (MT). Variations in activity of LIP and MST neurons just before motion onset were also predictive of the animals' subsequent perceived direction. These data suggest a hierarchy of representation in parietal cortex, whereby neuronal responses become more aligned with subjective perception in higher parietal areas.},

However, endogenous nucleic acids can also activate these TLRs, triggering autoimmunity. Nucleic acid-sensing TLRs initiate innate immune responses upon infection, but these receptors also initiate the development of protective adaptive immune responses. Therefore, TLR stimulation represents an attractive strategy for the development of therapeutic and prophylactic agents targeting microbial infections, cancers and allergies. The current use of stimulatory nucleic acids targeting TLRs is reviewed for applications ranging from vaccine adjuvants to anticancer, antiviral and anti-allergic agents.

	abstract = {BackgroundReliable access to basic services can improve a community's resilience to HIV/AIDS. Accordingly, work is being done to upgrade the physical infrastructure in affected areas, often employing a strategy of decentralised service provision. Spatial characteristics are one of the major determinants in implementing services, even in the smaller municipal areas, and good quality spatial information is needed to inform decision making processes. However, limited funds, technical infrastructure and human resource capacity result in little or no access to spatial information for crucial infrastructure development decisions at local level.This research investigated whether it would be possible to develop a GIS for basic infrastructure planning and management at local level. Given the resource constraints of the local government context, particularly in small municipalities, it was decided that open source software should be used for the prototype system.ResultsThe design and development of a prototype system illustrated that it is possible to develop an open source GIS system that can be used within the context of local information management. Usability tests show a high degree of usability for the system, which is important considering the heavy workload and high staff turnover that characterises local government in South Africa. Local infrastructure management stakeholders interviewed in a case study of a South African municipality see the potential for the use of GIS as a communication tool and are generally positive about the use of GIS for these purposes. They note security issues that may arise through the sharing of information, lack of skills and resource constraints as the major barriers to adoption.ConclusionThe case study shows that spatial information is an identified need at local level. Open source GIS software can be used to develop a system to provide local-level stakeholders with spatial information. However, the suitability of the technology is only a part of the system – there are wider information and management issues which need to be addressed before the implementation of a local-level GIS for infrastructure management can be successful.},

@article{citeulike:4872420,
	abstract = {Identification of mutations, which cause genetic diseases can be difficult when the disease is caused by the mutation of a large gene, which contains multiple exons. Detection of these mutations by DNA sequencing can be made more efficient by using mutation detection methods for pre-screening to identify the affected exon and to screen for the presence of already identified mutations in family members. These screening methods include denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), single-strand conformation polymorphism, conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE), heteroduplex analysis and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these methods by reviewing the results of studies screening for mutations causing multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by endocrine tumours of the anterior pituitary gland, parathyroid glands, and pancreas. MEN 1 is caused by mutations of the  MEN1  gene, a tumour suppressor gene, which contains one untranslated exon and nine exons. Previous studies have identified more than 400 germline and somatic mutations spreading across all the encoding sequence, and found no mutational  ” hot spot” or genotype–phenotype correlation. The wide diversity of mutations in the entire coding region of the  MEN1  gene makes mutation screening time-consuming and expensive. We conclude that combination of mutation detection methods with DNA sequencing enhances the efficiency of identifying pathogenic mutations. However, it should be considered that experimental determination of the optimal electrophoresis conditions, such as using perpendicular electrophoresis to optimise DGGE or TGGE, is more useful than computerized algorithms to calculate these parameters.},

Identifying 'extreme parameter regimes', the model is accessible to analytical perturbation theory, which justifies formal procedures well known in the physical literature: reduction to 2d and 1d GPEs, approximation of ground state solutions of the GPE and geometrical optics approximations. Then we use a time-splitting spectral method to discretize the time-dependent GPE.

This has lead to the development of methods to screen DNA for mutations as well as methods to detect previously described mutations. This review discusses current methods used for such purposes with special emphasis on genetic diseases of humans. However, savings can be made by similar means in other areas of biology where repetitive or extensive sequencing for comparative purposes needs to be done. This review covers the methods used for detection of unknown mutations, namely the ribonuclease, denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis, carbodiimide, chemical cleavage, single-strand conformation polymorphism, heteroduplex and sequencing methods. Once mutations have been defined they can be searched for repeatedly by methods referred to as diagnostic methods. Such methods include allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, allele-specific amplification, ligation, primer extension and the artificial introduction of restriction sites. We can now choose from a range of excellent methods, but the choice will usually depend on the background of the laboratory and/or the application in hand.

At such interfaces, prediction of the thermodynamics governing the formation of spatially ordered 2D arrangements is far from being fully understood, even for the physisorption of a single molecular component on the basal plane of a flat surface. Two recent contributions on controlled polymorphism and nanopattern formation render it possible to gain semi-quantitative insight into the thermodynamics of physisorption at interfaces, paving the way towards 2D supramolecular crystal engineering. Although in these two works different systems have been chosen to tackle such a complex task, authors showed that the chemical design of molecular building blocks is not the only requirement to fulfill when trying to preprogram self-assembled patterns at the solid-liquid interface.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  One of the fruits of the Human Genome Project is the discovery of millions of DNA sequence variants in the human genome. The majority of these variants are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A dense set of SNP markers opens up the possibility of studying the genetic basis of complex diseases by population approaches. In all study designs, a large number of individuals must be genotyped with a large number of markers. In this review, the current status of SNP genotyping is discussed in terms of the mechanisms of allelic discrimination, the reaction formats, and the detection modalities. A number of genotyping methods currently in use are described to illustrate the approaches being taken. Although no single genotyping method is ideally suited for all applications, a number of good genotyping methods are available to meet the needs of many study designs. The challenges for SNP genotyping in the near future include increasing the speed of assay development, reducing the cost of the assays, and performing multiple assays in parallel. Judging from the accelerated pace of new method development, it is hopeful that an ideal SNP genotyping method will be developed soon.},

In the past decade the use of noninvasive functional imaging, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has dramatically increased our detailed knowledge of the functional organization of the human visual cortex and its relation to visual perception. The fMRI method offers a major advantage over other techniques applied in neuroscience by providing a large-scale neuroanatomical perspective that stems from its ability to image the entire brain essentially at once. This bird's eye view has the potential to reveal large-scale principles within the very complex plethora of visual areas. Thus, it could arrange the entire constellation of human visual areas in a unified functional organizational framework. Here we review recent findings and methods employed to uncover the functional properties of the human visual cortex focusing on two themes: functional specialization and hierarchical processing.},

which provides a suitable candidate for the curvaton field. The class of models
considered also solves the mu problem, while generating the Peccei-Quinn scale
dynamically. The curvaton candidate is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson
corresponding to an angular degree of freedom orthogonal to the axion field.
Its order parameter increases substantially following a phase transition during
inflation. This results in a drastic amplification of the curvaton
perturbations. Consequently, the mechanism is able to accommodate low-scale
inflation with Hubble parameter at the TeV scale. Hence, we investigate modular
inflation using a string axion field as the inflaton with inflation scale
determined by gravity mediated soft supersymmetry breaking. We find that
modular inflation with the orthogonal axion as curvaton can indeed account for
the observations for natural values of the parameters.},

	abstract = {Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals. These neurodegenerative diseases are invariably fatal and can be transmitted by inoculation or dietary exposure. They are associated with the accumulation of an altered, disease-associated form of the normal prion protein. Pathologically, prion diseases result in neuronal cell death and a characteristic spongiform appearance of the brain tissue. The emergence of a variant form of CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom in 1996 has been causally and experimentally linked to the UK BSE epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s. The finding that BSE is transmissible to different animal species, unlike previously characterized prion diseases such as sheep scrapie, has raised enormous public health concerns worldwide. Although it is not yet possible to gauge the size of a potential vCJD epidemic, preliminary data indicate a significant dietary exposure to BSE-infected material in Britain and wider implications of the transmissibility of prion diseases. The threat to public health has intensified research efforts to understand the molecular basis of prion diseases, understand their transmission between species, improve methods of diagnosis, and develop therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of disease. In this review, we summarize current data on the pathology of BSE and vCJD and the epidemiology of vCJD, and we outline public health implications based on these data, emphasizing preventative measures and areas of research for screening and diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Context: Higher testosterone in black compared with white men has been postulated to explain their higher prostate cancer incidence. Previous studies comparing hormone levels by race might have been limited by size, restricted age variation, or lack of representation of the general population.  Objective: Our objective was to compare serum testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG concentrations among non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican-American men.  Participants, Design, and Setting: A total of 1413 men aged 20+ yr and who attended the morning examination session of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in 1988-1991 were included in this cross-sectional study.  Measurement: Serum hormone concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.  Results: After applying sampling weights and adjusting for age, percent body fat, alcohol, smoking, and activity, testosterone concentrations were not different between non-Hispanic blacks (n = 363; geometric mean, 5.29 ng/ml) and non-Hispanic whites (n = 674; 5.11 ng/ml; P > 0.05) but were higher in Mexican-Americans (n = 376; 5.48 ng/ml; P < 0.05). Non-Hispanic blacks (40.80 pg/ml) had a higher estradiol concentration than non-Hispanic whites (35.46 pg/ml; P < 0.01) and Mexican-Americans (34.11 pg/ml; P < 0.01). Non-Hispanic blacks (36.49 nmol/liter) had a higher SHBG concentration than non-Hispanic whites (34.91 nmol/liter; P < 0.05) and Mexican-Americans (35.04 nmol/liter; P < 0.05).  Conclusions: Contrary to the postulated racial difference, testosterone concentrations did not differ notably between black and white men. However, blacks had higher estradiol levels. Mexican-Americans had higher testosterone than whites but similar estradiol and SHBG concentrations. Given these findings, it may be equally if not more important to investigate estradiol as testosterone in relation to diseases with racial disparity. 10.1210/jc.2007-0028},

A different pattern of superordinate word acquisition was found between 3-year-olds and 4- and 5-year-olds. Although 4- and 5-year-olds could learn and extend novel words to superordinate categories in the presence of two picture exemplars from different categories or a single three-dimensional (3-D) exemplar, 3-year-olds could do so only in the presence of two 3-D exemplars. These findings indicate that young children's acquisition of superordinate words is influenced by multiple factors and that there is a developmental progression from multiple exemplars to single exemplars in superordinate word learning.},

	abstract = {Among many existing distance measures for time series data, Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW) distance has been recognized as one of the most accurate and
suitable distance measures due to its flexibility in sequence alignment.
However, DTW distance calculation is computationally intensive. Especially in
very large time series databases, sequential scan through the entire database
is definitely impractical, even with random access that exploits some index
structures since high dimensionality of time series data incurs extremely high
I/O cost. More specifically, a sequential structure consumes high CPU but low
I/O costs, while an index structure requires low CPU but high I/O costs. In
this work, we therefore propose a novel indexed sequential structure called
TWIST (Time Warping in Indexed Sequential sTructure) which benefits from both
sequential access and index structure. When a query sequence is issued, TWIST
calculates lower bounding distances between a group of candidate sequences and
the query sequence, and then identifies the data access order in advance, hence
reducing a great number of both sequential and random accesses. Impressively,
our indexed sequential structure achieves significant speedup in a querying
process by a few orders of magnitude. In addition, our method shows superiority
over existing rival methods in terms of query processing time, number of page
accesses, and storage requirement with no false dismissal guaranteed.},

An enriched environment is a housing condition with several objects such as a running wheel, tube and ladder, which are thought to increase sensory, cognitive and motor stimulation in rodents compared with standard housing conditions. First, we measured the number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of fetuses from pregnant dams housed in an enriched environment. Our results revealed that maternal enrichment influences cell proliferation in the hippocampus of female, but not male, fetuses. Second, we used the open-field test to investigate postnatal behaviors in the offspring of dams housed in the enriched environment during pregnancy. We found that maternal enrichment significantly affects the locomotor activity and time spent in the center of the open-field in female, but not male, offspring.

Microfluidic components have been developed and integrated to construct a microfluidic biochemical detection system. Magnetic bead-based immunoassay, as a typical example of biochemical detection and analysis, has been successfully performed on the integrated microfluidic biochemical analysis system that includes a surface-mounted biofilter and electrochemical sensor on a glass microfluidic motherboard. Total time required for an immunoassay was less than 20 min including sample incubation time, and sample volume wasted was less than 50 [micro sign]l during five repeated assays. Fast and low-volume biochemical analysis has been successfully achieved with the developed biofilter and immunosensor, which is integrated to the microfluidic system. Such a magnetic bead-based biochemical detection system, described in this paper, can be applied to protein analysis systems.},

	abstract = {Carcinoma of the prostate is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of death as a result of cancer in men in the United States and in many other Western countries. Notwithstanding the importance of this malignancy, little is understood about its causes. The epidemiology of prostate cancer strongly suggests that environmental factors, particularly diet and nutrition, are major determinants of risk for this disease, and evidence is mounting that there are important genetic risk factors for prostate cancer. Human prostate carcinomas are often androgen sensitive and react to hormonal therapy by temporary remission, followed by relapse to an androgen-insensitive state. These well-established features of prostate cancer strongly suggest that steroid hormones, particularly androgens, play a major role in human prostatic carcinogenesis, but the precise mechanisms by which androgens affect this process are unknown. In addition, the possible involvement of estrogenic hormones is not entirely clear. The purpose of this overview is to summarize the literature about steroid hormonal factors, androgens and estrogens, and prostate carcinogenesis. From these literature observations, a multifactorial general hypothesis of prostate carcinogenesis emerges with androgens as strong tumor promoters acting via androgen receptor-mediated mechanisms to enhance the carcinogenic activity of strong endogenous genotoxic carcinogens, such as reactive estrogen metabolites and estrogen- and prostatitis-generated reactive oxygen species and possible weak environmental carcinogens of unknown nature. In this hypothesis, all of these processes are modulated by a variety of environmental factors such as diet and by genetic determinants such as hereditary susceptibility and polymorphic genes that encode for steroid hormone receptors and enzymes involved in the metabolism and action of steroid hormones.},

@article{citeulike:4872178,
	abstract = {C1 domains, cysteine-rich modules originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, are present in multiple signaling families, including PKDs, chimaerins, RasGRPs, diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) and others. Typical C1 domains bind the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and DAG-mimetics such as phorbol esters, and are critical for governing association to membranes. On the contrary, atypical C1 domains possess structural determinants that impede phorbol ester/DAG binding. C1 domains are generally expressed as twin modules (C1A and C1B) or single domains. Biochemical and cellular studies in PKC and PKD isozymes revealed that C1A and C1B domains are non-equivalent as lipid-binding motifs or translocation modules. It has been recently determined that individual C1 domains have unique patterns of ligand recognition, driven in some cases by subtle structural differences. Insights from recent 3-D studies on beta2-chimaerin and Munc13-1 revealed that their single C1 domains are sterically blocked by intramolecular interactions, suggesting that major conformational changes would be required for exposing the site of DAG interaction. Thus, it is clear that the protein context plays a major role in determining whether binding of DAG to the C1 domain would lead to enzyme activation or merely serves as an anchoring mechanism.},

These models try to capture both the general purpose properties of models like the PRAM or BSP on the one hand, and to exploit network locality of special purpose models like meshes, hypercubes, etc., on the other hand. They do so by charging a cost  l (| i − j |) for a communication between processors  i  and  j , where  l  is a suitably chosen latency function. An upper bound  T ( p )=∑ i =0 loglog p 2 i · l ( p 1/2 i ) on the runtime of a broadcast on a  p  processor H-PRAM is given, for an arbitrary latency function  l ( k ). The main contribution of the paper is a matching lower bound, holding for all latency functions in the range from  l ( k )=Ω(log k /loglog k ) to  l ( k )=O(log 2 k ). This is not a severe restriction since for latency functions  l ( k )=O(log k /log 1+ log( k )) with arbitrary  >0, the runtime of the algorithm matches the trivial lower bound Ω(log p ) and for  l ( k )=Θ(log 1+ k ) or  l ( k )=Θ( k ), the runtime matches the other trivial lower bound Ω( l ( p )). Both upper and lower bounds apply for other parallel locality models like Y-PRAM, D-BSP and E-BSP, too.},

	abstract = {We calculate the bispectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
temperature anisotropies induced by the second-order fluctuations in the
Boltzmann equation. In this paper, which is one of a series of papers on the
numerical calculation of the bispectrum from the second-order fluctuations, we
consider the terms that are products of the first-order perturbations, and
leave intrinsically second-order terms and perturbations in the recombination
history to the subsequent papers. We show that the bispectrum has the maximum
signal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordial
bispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of the
first-order terms in position space. However, detailed calculations show that
their shapes are sufficiently different: the cross-correlation coefficient
reaches 0.5 at the maximum multipole of l\_{max}\~{} 200, and then weakens to 0.3
at l\_{max}\~{} 2000. The differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acoustic
oscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not being
scale-invariant. This implies that the contamination of the primordial
bispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of the
first-order terms) is small. The expected signal-to-noise ratio of the products
of the first-order terms is \~{} 0.4 at l\_{max}\~{} 2000 for a full-sky, cosmic
variance limited experiment. We therefore conclude that the products of the
first-order terms may be safely ignored in the analysis of the future CMB
experiments. The expected contamination of the local-form f\_{NL} is
f^{local}\_{NL}\~{} 0.9 at l\_{max}\~{} 200, and f^{local}\_{NL}\~{} 0.5 at l\_{max}\~{} 2000.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Typical analysis of microarray data has focused on spot by spot comparisons within a single organism. Less analysis has been done on the comparison of the entire distribution of spot intensities between experiments and between organisms. RESULTS: Here we show that mRNA transcription data from a wide range of organisms and measured with a range of experimental platforms show close agreement with Benford's law (Benford, PROC: Am. Phil. Soc., 78, 551-572, 1938) and Zipf's law (Zipf, The Psycho-biology of Language: an Introduction to Dynamic Philology, 1936 and Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort, 1949). The distribution of the bulk of microarray spot intensities is well approximated by a log-normal with the tail of the distribution being closer to power law. The variance, sigma(2), of log spot intensity shows a positive correlation with genome size (in terms of number of genes) and is therefore relatively fixed within some range for a given organism. The measured value of sigma(2) can be significantly smaller than the expected value if the mRNA is extracted from a sample of mixed cell types. Our research demonstrates that useful biological findings may result from analyzing microarray data at the level of entire intensity distributions.},

The purposes of this study were 1) to describe the rolling movements of adults and 2) to determine whether the movement patterns used to roll might represent different developmental steps within three body regions. Thirty-six healthy adult subjects were videotaped during 10 trials of rolling from a supine to a prone position. Written descriptions of each subject's movements were reduced to general categorical descriptions of movement patterns for three body regions (upper extremities, lower extremities, and head and trunk). Stage theory criteria were used in an attempt to order the movement patterns into developmental sequences. The most common combination of movement patterns was used to describe adults' rolling action. Although stage theory criteria were not met, developmental sequences of movement patterns were proposed for the three body regions. Subjects were quite variable in their rolling movements. The most common form of rolling occurred in less than 12\% of the subjects' trials. The descriptions of adults' rolling action gathered in this study provide physical therapists with a variety of movement patterns for teaching patients to roll.},

In this paper we combine the boomerang (and the rectangle) attack with related-key differentials.The new combination is applicable to many ciphers, and we demonstrate its strength by introducing attacks on reduced-round versions of AES and IDEA. The attack on 192-bit key 9-round AES uses 256 different related keys. The 6.5-round attack on IDEA uses four related keys (and has time complexity of 2 88.1 encryptions). We also apply these techniques to COCONUT98 to obtain a distinguisher that requires only four related-key adaptive chosen plaintexts and ciphertexts.

METHODS: Subjects participated in a five-week program of conductive education, intensive therapy, or special education. Professionals, blinded to group assignment, administered the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), and the Fine Motor Scale of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales before and after intervention. Professionals providing treatment and parents completed a survey about their perceptions of change in the children. RESULTS: ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences between groups before or after treatment. Using t-tests, statistically significant within group changes were found only for the intensive therapy group on the PEDI Self-care and Social Function scales and the Crawling and Kneeling scale of the GMFM. Individual changes from pre- to post-test were also examined and are discussed. Surveys revealed that both parents and professionals perceived improvement in all children. CONCLUSIONS: Greatest improvements were noted in the group receiving intensive therapy, with children in all groups showing some improvement in function.},

At molecular separations of a few nanometres or less, these interactions are the familiar van der Waals forces. However, as recognized in the theories of Casimir, Polder and Lifshitz, at larger distances and between macroscopic condensed media they reveal retardation effects associated with the finite speed of light. Although these long-range forces exist within all matter, only attractive interactions have so far been measured between material bodies. Here we show experimentally that, in accord with theoretical prediction, the sign of the force can be changed from attractive to repulsive by suitable choice of interacting materials immersed in a fluid. The measured repulsive interaction is found to be weaker than the attractive. However, in both cases the magnitude of the force increases with decreasing surface separation. Repulsive Casimir\&\#19;Lifshitz forces could allow quantum levitation of objects in a fluid and lead to a new class of switchable nanoscale devices with ultra-low static friction.},

Here we report the use of cDNA microarrays containing 9216 clones to measure global patterns of gene expression in these neoplasms. We have used a statistical algorithm to identify 375 genes, which divide patients with head and neck tumors into two clinically distinct subgroups based on gene expression patterns.

@article{Hu:2007pj,
	abstract = {We develop a parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) framework which describes
three regimes of modified gravity models that accelerate the expansion without
dark energy. On large scales, the evolution of scalar metric and density
perturbations must be compatible with the expansion history defined by distance
measures. On intermediate scales in the linear regime, they form a
scalar-tensor theory with a modified Poisson equation. On small scales in dark
matter halos such as our own galaxy, modifications must be suppressed in order
to satisfy stringent local tests of general relativity. We describe these
regimes with three free functions and two parameters: the relationship between
the two metric fluctuations, the large and intermediate scale relationships to
density fluctuations and the two scales of the transitions between the regimes.
We also clarify the formal equivalence of modified gravity and generalized dark
energy. The PPF description of linear fluctuation in f(R) modified action and
the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld models show excellent agreement with
explicit calculations. Lacking cosmological simulations of these models, our
non-linear halo-model description remains an ansatz but one that enables
well-motivated consistency tests of general relativity. The required
suppression of modifications within dark matter halos suggests that the linear
and weakly non-linear regimes are better suited for making complementary test
of general relativity than the deeply non-linear regime.},

@article{citeulike:4718935,
	abstract = {Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a conserved component of the Ras pathway that acts as a molecular scaffold to promote signal transmission from Raf-1 to MEK and MAPK. All KSR proteins contain a conserved cysteine-rich C1 domain, and studies have implicated this domain in the regulation of KSR1 subcellular localization and function. To further elucidate the biological role of the KSR1 C1 domain, we have determined its three-dimensional solution structure using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We find that while the overall topology of the KSR1 C1 domain is similar to the C1 domains of Raf-1 and PKCgamma, the predicted ligand-binding region and the surface charge distribution are unique. Moreover, by generating chimeric proteins in which these domains have been swapped, we find that the C1 domains of Raf-1, PKCgamma, and KSR1 are not functionally interchangeable. The KSR1 C1 domain does not bind with high affinity or respond biologically to phorbol esters or ceramide, and it does not interact directly with Ras, indicating that the putative ligand(s) for the KSR1 C1 domain are distinct from those that interact with PKCgamma and Raf-1. In addition, our analysis of the chimeric proteins supports the model that Raf-1 is a ceramide-activated kinase and that its C1 domain is involved in the ceramide-mediated response. Finally, our findings demonstrate an absolute requirement of the KSR1 C1 domain in mediating the membrane localization of KSR1, a crucial feature of its scaffolding activity. Together, these results underscore the functional specificity of these important regulatory domains and demonstrate that the structural features of the C1 domains can provide valuable insight into their ligand-binding properties.},

Since their discovery in laboratory environments in 1994, such crystals have been the subject of a variety of experimental, theoretical, and numerical investigations. Laboratory experiments analyzing the behavior of dust grains in a plasma rely on optical diagnostics to provide data about the system in a non-perturbative manner. In the past, capturing, imaging, and analyzing crystalline structure in dusty plasmas has been a non-trivial problem. Utilizing digital imaging and analysis systems, data capture, image formatting, and analysis can be done quickly. Following data capture, image analysis is conducted using modified Particle Image Velocimetry and Particle Tracking Velocimetry algorithms. The data extracted is then used to construct Voronoi diagrams, calculate particle density, inter-particle spacing, pair correlation functions, and thermal energy.

RESULTS: The prone group scored higher than the no prone group on the AIMS total scores (U = 36, p = 0.004), total percentile scores (U = 42, p = 0.003), and prone subscale scores (U = 25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gross motor performance as measured by the AIMS was more advanced in infants who slept supine and had been placed in the prone position when awake than in infants who slept supine but had limited or no experience in the prone position while awake. The influence of awake positioning needs to be considered when interpreting the developmental motor performance of infants who are six months old.},

	abstract = {We examined the possibility that neurons or groups of neurons along the retino-cortical transmission chain have properties of tuned oscillators: To this end, we studied the resonance properties of the retino-thalamo-cortical system of anaesthetized cats by entraining responses with flicker stimuli of variable frequency (2-50 Hz). Responses were assessed from multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) with up to four spatially segregated electrodes placed in areas 17 and 18. MUA and LFP responses were closely related, units discharging with high preference during LFP negativity. About 300 ms after flicker onset, responses stabilized and exhibited a highly regular oscillatory patterning that was surprisingly similar at different recording sites due to precise stimulus locking. Fourier transforms of these steady state oscillations showed maximal power at the inducing frequency and consistently revealed additional peaks at harmonic frequencies. The frequency-dependent amplitude changes of the fundamental and harmonic response components suggest that the retino-cortical system is entrainable into steady state oscillations over a broad frequency range and exhibits preferences for distinct frequencies in the theta- or slow alpha-range, and in the beta- and gamma-band. Concomitant activation of the mesencephalic reticular formation increased the ability of cortical cells to follow high frequency stimulation, and enhanced dramatically the amplitude of first- and second-order harmonics in the gamma-frequency range between 30 and 50 Hz. Cross-correlations computed between responses recorded simultaneously from different sites revealed pronounced synchronicity due to precise stimulus locking. These results suggest that the retino-cortical system contains broadly tuned, strongly damped oscillators which altogether exhibit at least three ranges of preferred frequencies, the relative expression of the preferences depending on the central state. These properties agree with the characteristics of oscillatory responses evoked by non-temporally modulated stimuli, and they indicate that neuronal responses along the retino-cortical transmission chain can become synchronized with precision in the millisecond range not only by intrinsic interactions, but also by temporally structured stimuli.},

Fifteen children with a diagnosis of CP were recruited (9 males, 6 females; mean age 7 years 4 months, SD 2 years 8 months; age range 2 to 12 years). Types of motor disorder were as follows: spastic quadriplegia (n=9); spastic diplegia (n=4); athetoid quadriplegia (n=1), and ataxia (n=1). Participants were distributed across the following Gross Motor Function Classification levels: level I, n=1; level II, n=4; level III, n=5; level IV, n=4; and level V, n=1. Children awaiting orthopaedic intervention were excluded. A repeated measures design was used with participants tested with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) at 6-weekly intervals (baseline, before and after Bobath therapy, and follow-up). As the data were of ordinal type, non-parametric statistics were used, i.e. Wilcoxon's test. Participants showed a significant improvement in scores in the following areas following Bobath therapy compared with the periods before and after Bobath therapy: GMFM total score (p=0.009); GMFM goal total (p=0.001); PEDI self care skills (p=0.036); and PEDI caregiver assistance total score (p=0.012). This demonstrates that in this population, gains were made in motor function and self care following a course of Bobath therapy.},

The former served as a poorly designed system suffering from architectural problems, while the latter served as an improved system where design problems had been solved by appropriate patterns. The experiment allowed the quantitative evaluation of students' preference to patterns. Moreover, it was possible to assess students' ability in relating design problems with patterns and interpreting the impact of patterns on software metrics.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:In recent years, the maturation of microarray technology has allowed the genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns to identify tissue-specific and ubiquitously-expressed ("housekeeping") genes. We have performed a functional and topological analysis of housekeeping and tissue-specific networks to identify universally-necessary biological processes, and those unique to or characteristic of particular tissues.RESULTS:We measured whole genome expression in 31 human tissues, identifying 2,374 housekeeping (HK) genes expressed in all tissues, and genes uniquely expressed in each tissue. Comprehensive functional analysis showed that the HK set is substantially larger than previously thought, and is enriched with vital processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, translation, and energy metabolism. Network topology of the HK network was characterized by higher connectivity and shorter paths between the proteins than the global network. Ontology enrichment scoring and network topology of tissue-specific genes were consistent with each tissue's function and expression patterns clustered together in accordance with tissue origin. Tissue-specific genes were twice as likely as HK genes to be drug targets, allowing the identification of tissue "signature networks" that will facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers of tissue-targeted diseases. CONCLUSIONS:A comprehensive functional analysis of housekeeping and tissue specific genes showed that the biological function of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes were consistent with tissue origin. Network analysis revealed that tissue-specific networks have distinct network properties related to each tissue's function. Tissue "signature networks" promise to be a rich source of targets and biomarkers for disease treatment and diagnosis.},

The paper presents an empirical study to understand whether there are roles that are more change-prone than others and whether there are changes that are more likely to occur to certain roles. The study relies on data extracted from the source code repositories of three different systems (JHotDraw, Xerces, and Eclipse-JDT) and from 12 design patterns. Results obtained confirm the intuitive behavior about changeability of many roles in design motifs, but also warns about properly designing parts of the motif subject to frequent changes.},

@article{citeulike:4872047,
	abstract = {A continuing focus of our work has been an effort to understand the signal transduction pathways through which insulin achieves its cellular actions. In the mid-1970s, we and others observed that insulin promoted an increase in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of a subset of cellular proteins. This finding was unanticipated, inasmuch as nearly all of the actions of insulin then known appeared to result from protein dephosphorylation. In fact, nearly 15 years elapsed before any physiologic response to insulin attributable to stimulated (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation was established. Nevertheless, based on the hypothesis that insulin-stimulated Ser/Thr phosphorylation reflected the activation of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases downstream of the insulin receptor, we sought to detect and purify these putative, insulin-responsive protein (Ser/Thr) kinases. Our effort was based on the presumption that an understanding of the mechanism for their activation would provide an entry into the biochemical reactions through which the insulin receptor activated its downstream effectors. To a degree that, in retrospect, is surprising, this goal was accomplished, much in the way originally envisioned. It is now well known that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) recruit a large network of protein (Ser/Thr) kinases to execute their cellular programs. The first of these insulin-activated protein kinase networks to be fully elucidated was the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. This pathway is a central effector of cellular differentiation in development; moreover, its inappropriate and continuous activation provides a potent promitogenic force and is a very common occurrence in human cancers. Conversely, this pathway contributes minimally, if at all, to insulin's program of metabolic regulation. Nevertheless, the importance of the Ras-MAPK pathway in metazoan biology and human malignancies has impelled us to an ongoing analysis of the functions and regulation of Ras and Raf. This chapter will summarize briefly the way in which work from this and other laboratories on insulin signaling led to the discovery of the mammalian MAP kinase cascade and, in turn, to the identification of unique role of the Raf kinases in RTK activation of this protein (Ser/Thr) kinase cascade. We will then review in more detail current understanding of the biochemical mechanism through which the Ras proto-oncogene, in collaboration with the 14-3-3 protein and other protein kinases, initiates activation of the Raf kinase.},

We addressed two outstanding questions about attention-based rehearsal: the topography of the attention-based rehearsal effect, and the mechanism by which it operates. Using event-related fMRI and a procedure that randomized the presentation of trials with delay epochs that were either filled with a flickering checkerboard or unfilled, we localized the effect to extrastriate areas 18 and 19, and confirmed its absence in striate cortex. Delay-epoch activity in these extrastriate regions, as well as in superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus, was also lateralized on unfilled trials, suggesting that attention-based rehearsal produces a baseline shift in areas representing the to-be-remembered location in space. No frontal regions (including frontal eye fields) demonstrated lateralized activity consistent with a role in attention-based rehearsal.},

@article{citeulike:276667,
	abstract = {Errors in requirements specifications have been identified as a major contributor to costly software project failures. It would be highly beneficial if information systems developers could verify requirements by predicting workplace acceptance of a new system based on user evaluations of its specifications measured during the earliest stages of the development project, ideally before building a working prototype. However, conventional wisdom among system developers asserts that prospective users must have direct hands-on experience with at least a working prototype of a new system before they can provide assessments that accurately reflect future usage behavior after workplace implementation. The present research demonstrates that this assumption is only partially true. Specifically, it is true that stable and predictive assessments of a system's perceived ease of use should be based on direct behavioral experience using the system. However, stable and behaviorally predictive measures of perceived usefulness can be captured from target users who have received information about a system's functionality, but have not had direct hands-on usage experience. This distinction is key because, compared to ease of use, usefulness is generally much more strongly linked to future usage intentions and behaviors in the workplace. Two longitudinal field experiments show that preprototype usefulness measures can closely approximate hands-on based usefulness measures, and are significantly predictive of usage intentions and behavior up to six months after workplace implementation. The present findings open the door toward research on how user acceptance testing may be done much earlier in the system development process than has traditionally been the case. Such preprototype user acceptance tests have greater informational value than their postprototype counterparts because they are captured when only a relatively small proportion of project costs have been incurred and there is greater flexibility to modify a new system's design attributes. Implications are discussed for future research to confirm the robustness of the present findings and to better understand the practical potential and limitations of preprototype user acceptance testing.},

While we focus on the field of gender and education as a whole (including its journals and academic practices), our main sources of evidence are our own experiences as gender researchers on different sides of the Anglophone divide, and a small survey of articles in this journal, <i>Gender and Education</i>, chosen because it is the main journal of choice for those hoping to make a contribution to the field. We examined articles published in three years, 1990, 1998 and 2007, in order to identify if and how the journal (and hence the field) has changed in orientation over time. Following a discussion of the survey outcomes, we draw attention in particular to the journals Anglophone orientation and the implications this has for the field as a whole. We further argue for greater reflexivity about our and others practices as feminist academics, and propose some strategies for action with the aim of making the field more inclusive.},

	abstract = {Coalition formation is a desirable behavior in a multiagent system, when a group of agents can perform a task more efficiently than any single agent can. Computational and communications complexity of traditional approaches to coalition formation, e.g., through negotiation, make them impractical for large systems. We propose an alternative, physics-motivated mechanism for coalition formation that treats agents as randomly moving, locally interacting entities. A new coalition may form when two agents encounter one another and it may grow when a single agent encounters it. Such agent-level behavior leads to a macroscopic model that describes how the number and distribution of coalitions change with time. We increase the generality and complexity of the model by letting the agents leave coalitions with some probability. The model is expressed mathematically as a series of differential equations. These equations have steady state solutions that describe the equilibrium distribution of coalitions. Within a context of a specific multi-agent application, we analyze and discuss the connection between the global system utility the parameters of the model},

	abstract = {Learning concepts that change over time is important for a variety of applications in which an intelligent system must acquire and use a behavioral profile. Computer intrusion detection, calendar scheduling, and intelligent user interfaces are three examples. An interesting class of methods for learning such concepts consists of algorithms that maintain a portion of previously encountered examples. Since concepts change over time and these methods store selected examples, mechanisms must exist to identify and remove irrelevant examples of old concepts. In this paper, we describe an incremental rule learner with partial instance memory, called AQ 11 -PM+WAH, that uses Widmer and Kubat's heuristic to adjust dynamically the window over which it retains and forgets examples. We evaluated this learner using the STAGGER concepts and made direct comparisons to AQ-PM and to AQ 11 - PM, similar learners with partial instance memory. Results suggest that the forgetting heuristic is not restricted to FLORA2 the learner for which it was originally designed. Overall, result from this study and others suggest learners with partial instance memory converge more quickly to changing target concepts than algorithms that learn solely from new examples.},

@article{citeulike:4871991,
	abstract = {The purpose of this work was to get insight into the role of frontal trunk and proximal extremity muscles in rolling from supine to side lying. Participants were seventeen hemiparetic patients and 14 healthy subjects. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the Sternocleidomasoid (ScM), Pectoralis Major (PM), External Oblique (ExO) and Rectus Femoris (RF) muscle pairs was recorded during rolling performance. Analysis included the establishment of EMG response times and magnitudes. For all muscles, initiation of EMG activity was delayed in the patients as compared with the controls. Among the healthy subjects, EMG activity level of the SCM was more enhanced on the mobile than on the stable body side, while activation level of the PM muscle was larger on the stable body side. In the hemiparetic group, the SCM demonstrated similar results as the controls yet, PM activity on the paretic side was lower than on the non-paretic side regardless of rolling direction. The difference in activation level between the corresponding ExO and RF muscles showed inconsistency among the healthy subjects, whereas in the hemipareic group the muscles on the paretic side never displayed higher activation levels than on the non-paretic side. In conclusion, rolling sideways in hemiparetic subjects is characterized by a normal relationship between activation levels of the SCM muscles while the relationship between the corresponding PM, ExO and RF muscles is hampered due to reduced activation level of the muscles on the paretic body side.},

@article{citeulike:3519650,
	abstract = {Background:\&\#10;Recently, microarray data analyses using functional pathway information, e.g., gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and significance analysis of function and expression (SAFE), have gained recognition as a way to identify biological pathways/processes  associated with a phenotypic endpoint. In these analyses, a local statistic is used to assess the association between the expression level of a gene and the value of a phenotypic endpoint. Then these gene-specific local statistics are combined to evaluate association for pre-selected sets of genes.  Commonly used local statistics include t-statistics for binary phenotypes and correlation coefficients that assume a linear or monotone relationship between a continuous phenotype and gene expression level.  Methods applicable to continuous non-monotone relationships are needed. Furthermore, for multiple experimental categories, methods that combine multiple GSEA/SAFE analyses are needed.\&\#10;Results:\&\#10;For continuous or ordinal phenotypic outcome, we propose to use as the local statistic the coefficient of multiple determination (i.e., the square of multiple correlation coefficient) \$R^2\$ from fitting natural cubic spline models to the phenotype-expression relationship. Next, we incorporate this association measure into the GSEA/SAFE framework to identify significant gene sets. Unsigned local statistics, signed global statistics and one-sided p-values are used to reflect our inferential interest. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for inference across multiple GSEA/SAFE analyses. We illustrate our approach using gene expression and liver injury data from liver and blood samples from rats treated with eight hepatotoxicants under multiple time and dose combinations. We set out to identify biological pathways/processes associated with liver injury as manifested by increased blood levels of alanine transaminase in common for most of the eight compounds. Potential statistical dependency resulting from the experimental design is addressed in permutation based hypothesis testing.\&\#10;Conclusion:\&\#10;The proposed framework captures both linear and non-linear association between gene expression level and a phenotypic endpoint and thus can be viewed as extending the current GSEA/SAFE methodology. The framework for combining results from multiple GSEA/SAFE analyses is  flexible to address practical inference interests. Our methods can be applied to microarray data with continuous phenotypes with multi-level design or the meta-analysis of multiple microarray data sets.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY: Accurate estimation of DNA copy numbers from array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data is important for characterizing the cancer genome. An important part of this process is the segmentation of the log-ratios between the sample and control DNA along the chromosome into regions of different copy numbers. However, multiple algorithms are available in the literature for this procedure and the results can vary substantially among these. Thus, a visualization tool that can display the segmented profiles from a number of methods can be helpful to the biologist or the clinician to ascertain that a feature of interest did not arise as an artifact of the algorithm. Such a tool also allows the methodologist to easily contrast his method against others. We developed a web-based tool that applies a number of popular algorithms to a single array CGH profile entered by the user. It generates a heatmap panel of the segmented profiles for each method as well as a consensus profile. The clickable heatmap can be moved along the chromosome and zoomed in or out. It also displays the time that each algorithm took and provides numerical values of the segmented profiles for download. The web interface calls algorithms written in the statistical language R.We encourage developers of new algorithms to submit their routines to be incorporated into the website.

	abstract = {During development of legume root nodules, rhizobia and their host plant cells undergo profound differentiation, which is underpinned by massive changes in gene expression in both symbiotic partners. Oxygen concentrations in infected and surrounding uninfected cells drop precipitously during nodule development. To assess what effects this has on plant and bacterial cell differentiation and gene expression, we used a leghemoglobin-RNA-interference (LbRNAi) line of Lotus japonicus, which is devoid of leghemoglobins and has elevated levels of free-oxygen in its nodules. Bacteroids in LbRNAi nodules showed altered ultrastructure indicating changes in bacterial differentiation. Transcript analysis of 189 plant and 192 bacterial genes uncovered many genes in both the plant and bacteria that were differentially regulated during nodulation of LbRNAi plants compared with the wild type (containing Lb and able to fix nitrogen). These included fix and nif genes of the bacteria, which are involved in microaerobic respiration and nitrogen fixation, respectively, and plant genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism. Metabolite analysis revealed decreased levels of many amino acids in nodules of LbRNAi plants, consistent with the defect in symbiotic nitrogen fixation of this line.},

Different models, based on tree-graphs, have been introduced to represent plants. These models assume that the scale of description is fixed. However, this hypothesis is too restrictive for new modeling applications that aim to tackle analysis or simulation of plant growth at different time and space scales. In order to make such multiscale descriptions available to computer applications, we have defined a general methodology for measuring and representing multiscale plant topological structures. This paper discusses the design of a model of plant topological structures and sketches out its general formal properties. The model supports multiscale, attributed and time-varying descriptions of plants. It is intended to be used for plant analysis methodologies and plant growth simulations.},

@article{Hsieh2003OptimalTaskAllocation,
	abstract = {A distributed computing system (DCS) in general consists of processing nodes, communication channels, and tasks. Achieving a reliable DCS thus comprises three parts: the realization of reliable task processing, reliable communication among processing nodes, and a good task allocation strategy. In this study, we examine the relationship between system cost and system reliability in a cycle-free hardware-redundant DCS where multiple processors are available at each processing node and multiple communication links are available at each communication channel. Intuitively, higher hardware redundancy leads to higher system reliability which results in the reduction of communication cost. Such an endowment of hardware redundancy, however, incurs higher hardware operating cost. A unified model of system cost is therefore developed in this study that is a complex function of task allocation and hardware redundancy policies, and a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) based on genetic algorithms and a local search procedure is proposed to seek the optimal task allocation and hardware redundancy policies. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated DCSs and compared with a simple genetic algorithm (SGA). The simulation results show that the HGA gives higher solution quality in less computational time than the SGA.},

Yet, the complexity of biological systems implies that our working definitions of diseases are careful discretizations of a complex phenotypic space. To reconcile the discrete nature of diseases with the complexity of biological organisms, we need to understand how diseases are connected, as connections between these different discrete categories can be informative about the mechanisms causing physiological failures. Here we introduce the Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN) as a map summarizing phenotypic connections between diseases and show that diseases progress preferentially along the links of this map. Furthermore, we show that this progression is different for patients with different genders and racial backgrounds and that patients affected by diseases that are connected to many other diseases in the PDN tend to die sooner than those affected by less connected diseases. Additionally, we have created a queryable online database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hudine.neu.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://hudine.neu.edu/</ext-link>) of the 18 different datasets generated from the more than 31 million patients in this study.

	abstract = {The objective of this research was the design and development of a region-based multi-scale segmentation algorithm with the integration of complex texture features, in order to provide a low level processing tool for object-oriented image analysis. The implemented algorithm is called Texture-based MSEG and can be described as a region merging procedure. The algorithm is composed of two profiles. In the simple profile, the main part of the segmentation algorithm was included. The first object representation is the single pixel of the image. Through iterative pair-wise object fusions, which are made at several iterations, called passes, the final segmentation is achieved. The criterion for object merging is a homogeneity cost measure, defined as object heterogeneity, and computed based on spectral and shape features for each possible object merge. The heterogeneity is then compared to a user defined threshold, called scale parameter, in order for the decision of the merge to be determined. The processing order of the primitive objects is defined through a procedure (Starting Point Estimation), which is based on image partitioning, statistical indices and dithering algorithms. The advanced profile was implemented as an extension of the simple profile and was designed to include multi-resolution functionality and a global heterogeneity heuristic module for improving the segmentation capabilities. As part of the advanced profile, an integration of texture features to the region merging segmentation procedure was implemented through an Advanced Texture Heuristics module. Towards this texture-enhanced segmentation method, complex statistical measures of texture had to be computed based on objects, however, and not on orthogonal image regions. For each image object the grey level co-occurrence matrices and their statistical features were computed. The Advanced Texture Heuristics module,},

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the ability to perform basic movements at the bedside, which were measured using a new scale, the Ability for Basic Movement Scale, in the early stage after stroke and functional ability at discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A total of 142 stroke patients participated in this prospective study. In addition to the Ability for Basic Movement Scale score, age, limb paresis as measured by the Brunnstrom stage, and functional ability as measured by the Barthel Index were also selected as predictor variables. RESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that the state of functional ability at discharge had significant positive correlations with total scores of the Ability for Basic Movement Scale and Brunnstrom stage at all stages of data collection. The results of linear stepwise regression analysis indicated that "turn over from supine position," "remain sitting," and "sit up" of the Ability for Basic Movement Scale at 10 days after onset, in addition to age at onset of stroke, the baseline Barthel Index, and the baseline Brunnstrom stage, were significant predictors (75.6\%) of functional ability at discharge.

The authors' hypothesis was that the KTT would produce less spinal motion while maintaining the benefits of body position changes. METHODS: Cervical and lumbar instability was created in three fresh, unembalmed cadavers. Electromagnetic sensors were fixed to the C5-6 and T12-L2 segments to measure cervical and lumbar spine segmental motion. Body position changes were performed using the traditional log-roll method and a KTT. Spinal motion was measured during each maneuver. Turning the cadaveric specimens on the KTT bed caused significantly less cervical motion than the log-roll technique as measured in flexion and axial rotation. The log-roll technique caused significantly greater cervical motion during body position changes than turning using the KTT. CONCLUSIONS: Although the global instability will require surgical stabilization, consideration should be given to initial immobilization on a KTT to decrease the likelihood of secondary injury.},

@article{geman1984,
	abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, non-linear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low-energy states (\&lsquo;annealing\&rsquo;), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel \&lsquo;relaxation\&rsquo; algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Current staging criteria do not fully capture the complexity of this disease. Survival could be improved by identification of those early-stage patients who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. Molecular classification by using mRNA expression profiles has led to multiple, poorly overlapping signatures. We hypothesized that differing statistical methodologies contribute to this lack of overlap. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed our previously published quantitative RT-PCR dataset with a semisupervised method. A 6-gene signature was identified and validated in 4 independent public microarray datasets that represent a range of tumor histologies and stages. This result demonstrated that at least 2 prognostic signatures can be derived from this single dataset. We next estimated the total number of prognostic signatures in this dataset with a 10-million-signature permutation study. Our 6-gene signature was among the top 0.02\% of signatures with maximum verifiability, reaffirming its efficacy. Importantly, this analysis identified 1,789 unique signatures, implying that our dataset contains >500,000 verifiable prognostic signatures for NSCLC.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the motor abilities of children with spastic cerebral palsy who were receiving functional physical therapy (physical therapy with an emphasis on practicing functional activities) improved more than the motor abilities of children in a reference group whose physical therapy was based on the principle of normalization of the quality of movement. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 55 children with mild or moderate cerebral palsy aged 2 to 7 years (median=55 months). METHODS: A randomized block design was used to assign the children to the 2 groups. After a pretest, the physical therapists for the functional physical therapy group received training in the systematic application of functional physical therapy. There were 3 follow-up assessments: 6, 12, and 18 months after the pretest. Both basic gross motor abilities and motor abilities in daily situations were studied, using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and the self-care and mobility domains of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), respectively. RESULTS: Both groups had improved GMFM and PEDI scores after treatment. No time x group interactions were found on the GMFM. For the PEDI, time x group interactions were found for the functional skills and caregiver assistance scales in both the self-care and mobility domains. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The groups' improvements in basic gross motor abilities, as measured by the GMFM in a standardized environment, did not differ. When examining functional skills in daily situations, as measured by the PEDI, children in the functional physical therapy group improved more than children in the reference group.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between both use of infant equipment and play positions and motor development of infants born preterm who were classified as high risk. Subjects were 60 parent-infant dyads attending a developmental follow-up clinic. METHODS: Parents reported the duration of infant equipment use and the predominant positions in which their infants played in the previous month. Infants were assessed using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). RESULTS: Equipment use was not related to motor development; however, the duration of carrying was negatively related to the sit subscale of the AIMS (r = -0.31, p < 0.05). As a group, the infants in this sample spent more time in the relatively less active play positions of sitting and supine than in the positions of prone and standing. CONCLUSIONS: Therapists should consider the use of equipment and specific play positions to enhance motor development of infants born preterm and work with parents to promote an understanding of the importance of providing their infants with opportunities to develop early motor competencies.},

	abstract = {Pyranose 2-oxidase (P2Ox) has several proposed biotechnological applications such as a bio-component in biofuel cells or for carbohydrate transformations. To improve some of the catalytic properties of P2Ox from Trametes multicolor, we selected a semi-rational approach of enzyme engineering, saturation mutagenesis of active-site residues and subsequent screening of mutant libraries for improved activity. One of the active-site mutants with improved catalytic characteristics identified was V546C, which showed catalytic constants increased by up to 5.7-fold for both the sugar substrates (D-glucose and D-galactose) and alternative electron acceptors (1,4-benzoquinone, BQ and ferricenium ion, Fc(+)], albeit at the expense of increased Michaelis constants. By combining V546C with other amino acid replacements, we obtained P2Ox variants that are of interest for biofuel cell applications due to their increased k(cat) for both BQ and Fc(+), e.g., V546C/E542K showed 4.4- and 17-fold increased k(cat) for BQ compared to the wild-type enzyme when D-glucose and D-galactose, respectively, were the saturating substrates, while V546C/T169G showed approx. 40- and 50-fold higher k(cat) for BQ and Fc(+), respectively, with D-galactose in excess. This latter variant also shows significantly modulated sugar substrate selectivity, due to an increase in k(cat)/K(M) for D-galactose and a decrease in k(cat)/K(M) for D-glucose when oxygen is the electron acceptor, as well as improved catalytic efficiencies for d-galactose, regardless of the electron acceptor used. While the wild-type enzyme strongly prefers D-glucose over D-galactose as its substrate, V546C/T169G converts both sugars equally well as was shown by the kinetic constants determined as well as by biotransformation experiments.},

It made the digital copies searchable through its web site - you couldn't read the books, but you could at least find out where the phrase you're looking for appears within them. This outraged copyright owners, who filed a class action lawsuit to make Google stop. Then, last fall, the parties to this large class action announced an even larger settlement: one that would give Google a license not only to scan books, but also to sell them.  The settlement tackles the orphan works problem, but through the judicial process. Laundering orphan works legislation through a class action lawsuit is both a brilliant response to legislative inaction and a dangerous use of the judicial power. Many of the public interest safeguards that would have been present in the political arena are attenuated in a seemingly private lawsuit; the lack of such safeguards is evident in the terms of the resulting settlement. The solution is to reinsert these missing public interest protections into the settlement.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether hippotherapy has an effect on the general functional development of children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: The study employed a repeated-measures design with two pre-tests and two post-tests conducted 10 weeks apart using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) and the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) as outcome measures. A convenience sample of 10 children with cerebral palsy participated whose ages were 2.3 to 6.8 years at baseline (mean +/- SD 4.1 +/- 1.7). Subjects received hippotherapy once weekly for 10 weeks between pre-test 2 and post-test 1. Test scores on the GMFM and PEDI were compared before and after hippotherapy. RESULTS: One-way analysis of variance of group mean scores with repeated measures was significant (p < 0.05) for all PEDI subscales and all GMFM dimensions except lying/rolling. Post hoc analyses with the Tukey test for honest significant differences on the PEDI and GMFM total measures as well as GMFM crawling/kneeling and PEDI social skills subtests were statistically significant between pre-test 2 and post-test 1. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that hippotherapy has a positive effect on the functional motor performance of children with cerebral palsy. Hippotherapy appears to be a viable treatment strategy for therapists with experience and training in this form of treatment and a means of improving functional outcomes in children with cerebral palsy, although specific functional skills were not investigated.},

	abstract = {The interaction between a conventional rectangular (primary) air jet and a co-flowing synthetic jet is investigated experimentally. The nozzles of both jets have the same long dimension but the aspect ratio of the synthetic jet orifice is 25 times larger. Detailed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the flow in the midspan plane show that primary jet fluid is directed into the synthetic jet orifice and the interaction between the jets leads to the formation of a closed recirculating flow domain. The concomitant formation of a low-pressure region between the jets results in deflection of the primary jet toward the actuator jet despite the absence of an extended control surface (e.g. a diffuser or collar) and is balanced by a force on the primary jet conduit. For a given synthetic jet strength and primary jet speed, the vectoring force depends mainly on the volume flow rate of primary jet fluid that is diverted into the synthetic jet actuator. This flow rate is regulated by restricting the flow of entrained ambient fluid using a small streamwise extension of the synthetic jet orifice that scales with the orifice width. The response of the primary jet to the imposed vectoring is investigated using stepped modulation of the driving signal. The characteristic vectoring time and vectoring angle decrease monotonically with primary jet speed.},

By means of chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray analysis, the divergence in the binding sites of the pseudohyphal regulators Ste12 and Tec1 was determined in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. mikatae, and S. bayanus under pseudohyphal conditions. We have shown that most of these sites have diverged across these species, far exceeding the interspecies variation in orthologous genes. A group of Ste12 targets was shown to be bound only in S. mikatae and S. bayanus under pseudohyphal conditions. Many of these genes are targets of Ste12 during mating in S. cerevisiae, indicating that specialization between the two pathways has occurred in this species. Transcription factor binding sites have therefore diverged substantially faster than ortholog content. Thus, gene regulation resulting from transcription factor binding is likely to be a major cause of divergence between related species. 10.1126/science.1140748},

	abstract = {Components of machine intelligence and and relation with soft computing are explained. The role of rough fuzzy computing in the said framework along with the relevance of integration is explained. Two examples of such integration are described for problems of clustering and generating class prototypes. Here rough sets are used for granular computing using information granules and for uncertainty handling in defining cluster shapes using lower and upper approximation, whereas fuzzy sets are used for linguistic representation and fuzzy granulation, and modeling uncertainty arising from overlapping regions. In effect, rough-fuzzy clustering provides a balanced compromise between restrictive (hard) and descriptive (fuzzy) representations of class belonging for overlapping regions. The use of rough sets as an ensemble classifier is then described. The ensemble of the base classifiers is optimum in the sense that the performance of the resulting classifier is at least equal to that of the best base classifier. The ensemble classifier is shown to be effective in classifying web documents and services. The significance of rough-fuzzy case generation is demonstrated in terms of case generation, case retrieval, average no. of features required per case and classification performance. The features and merits of rough-fuzzy clustering are demonstrated for determining the bio-bases in encoding protein sequence for analysis where the biobases coorrespond to c-medoids. New quantitative indices are stated in this context. The talk concludes with their future challenges and possible uses in data mining.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Multivariate experiments applied to mammalian cells often produce lists of proteins/genes altered under treatment vs. control conditions. Such lists can be projected onto prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to infer the list of kinases associated with a specific protein list. By computing how the proportion of kinases, associated with a specific list of proteins/genes, deviates from an expected distribution we can rank kinases and kinase families based on the likelihood that these kinases are functionally associated with regulating the cell under specific experimental conditions. Such analysis can assist in producing hypotheses that can explain how the kinome is involved in the maintenance of different cellular states and can be manipulated to modulate cells towards a desired phenotype.  Summary: Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) is a webbased tool with an underlying database providing users with the ability to link lists of mammalian proteins/genes with the kinases that phosphorylate them. The system draws from several available kinase-substrate databases to compute kinase enrichment probability based on the distribution of kinase-substrate proportions in the background kinase-substrate database compared with kinases found to be associated with an input list of genes/proteins  Availability: The KEA system is freely available at http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/lib/kea.jsp 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp026},

We show that CGIs located over the transcription start site (named start CGIs) are very different structurally from the others (named no-start CGIs): (1) 61.6\% of the no-start CGIs are due to repeated sequences (79 \% are due to s), whereas only 5.6\% of the start CGIs are due to such repeats; (2) start CGIs are longer and display a higher CpGo/e ratio and G + C level than no-start CGIs. The frequency of tissue-specific genes associated to a start CGI varies according to the genomic G + C content, from 25\% in G + C-poor isochores to 64\% in G + C-rich isochores. Conversely, the frequency of housekeeping genes associated to a start CGI (90\%) is independent of the isochore context. Interestingly, the structure of start CGIs is very similar for tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. Moreover, 93\% of genes expressed in early embryo are found to exhibit a CpG island over their transcription start point. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the occurrence of these CGIs is the consequence of gene expression at this stage, when the methylation pattern is installed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the ability of activity of daily living (ADL)-impaired older adults to successfully rise, and, when successful, the time taken to rise, from a bed and chair under varying rise task demands. SETTING: Seven congregate housing facilities SUBJECTS: Congregate housing residents (n = 116, mean age 82) who admitted to requiring assistance (such as from a person, equipment, or device) in performing at least one of the following mobility-related ADLs: transferring, walking, bathing, and toileting. METHODS: Subjects performed a series of bed and chair rise tasks where the rise task demand varied according to the head of bed (HOB) height, chair seat height, and use of hands. Bed rise tasks included supine to sit-to-edge, sit up in bed with hand use, and sit up in bed without hands, all performed from a bed where the HOB was adjusted to 0, 30, and 45 degrees elevations; roll to side-lying then rise (HOB 0 degrees); and supine to stand (HOB 0 degrees). Chair seat heights were adjusted according to the percent of the distance between the floor and the knee (\% FK), and included rises (1) with hands and then without hands at 140, 120, 100, and 80\% FK; (2) from a reclining (105 degrees at chair back) and tilting (seat tilted 10 degrees posteriorly) chair (100\% FK); and (3) from a 80\% FK seat height with a 4-inch cushion added, with and then without hands. Logistic regression for repeated measures was used to test for differences between tasks in the ability to rise. After log transformation of rise time, a linear effects model was used to compare rise time between tasks. RESULTS: The median total number of tasks successfully completed was 18 (range, 3-21). Nearly all subjects were able to rise from positions where the starting surface was elevated as long as hand use was unlimited. With the HOB at 30 or 45 degrees essentially all subjects could complete supine to sit-to-edge and sit up with hands. Essentially all subjects could rise from a seat height at 140, 120, and 100\% FK as long as hand use was allowed. A small group (8-10\%) of subjects was dependent upon hand use to perform the least challenging tasks, such as 140\% FK without hands chair rise and 45 degrees sit up without hands. This dependency upon hand use increased significantly as the demand of the task increased, that is, as the HOB or seat height was lowered. Approximately three-quarters of the sample could not rise from a flat (0 degrees HOB elevation) bed or low (80\% FK) chair when hand use was not allowed. Similar trends were seen in rise performance time, that is, performance times tended to increase as the HOB or chair seat elevation declined and as hand use was limited. Total self-reported ADL disability, compared to the single ADL transferring item, was a stronger predictor of rise ability and timed rise performance, particularly for chair rise tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Lowering HOB height and seat height increased bed and chair rise task difficulty, particularly when hand use was restricted. Restricting hand use in low HOB height or lowered seat height conditions may help to identify older adults with declining rise ability. Yet, many of those who could not rise under "without hands" conditions could rise under "with hands" conditions, suggesting that dependency on hand use may be a marker of progressive rise impairment but may not predict day-to-day natural milieu rise performance. Intertask differences in performance time may be statistically significant but are clinically small. Given the relationship between self-reported ADL disability and rise performance, impaired rise performance may be considered a marker for ADL disability. These bed and chair rise tasks can serve as outcomes for an intervention to improve bed and chair rise ability and might also be used in future studies to quantify improvements or declines in function over time, to refine physical therapy protocols, and to examine the effect of bed and chair design modifications on bed and chai},

The haplotype structures in India are significantly different from those of EUR and AFR populations, indicating local adaptation to pathogens. In these genes, there is () generally an excess of rare variants, () high, but variable, degrees of extended haplotype homozygosity, () low tolerance to nonsynonymous changes, () essentially one or a few high-frequency haplotypes, with star-like phylogenies of other infrequent haplotypes radiating from the modal haplotypes.

	abstract = {Difficulty in transferring, the ability to rise in and out of a bed and chair, is a common problem in older adults, particularly those residing in skilled nursing facilities. Focusing on one aspect of transferring, rising from supine to sitting position, we devised a set of bed mobility tasks to test key arm, leg, and trunk movements that likely contribute to successful rising from bed. Healthy young controls (YC, n=22, mean age 23), and older adults (aged 60 and over) either residing independently in congregate housing (CH, n=29, mean age 84) or undergoing rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility (SNF, mean age 77) were assessed in the time to rise from supine to sitting and in the ability or inability to perform 16 other bed mobility tasks. Trunk function-related tasks, specifically those requiring trunk elevation and trunk balance, were most difficult for the SNF, followed by CH, and then YC. Tasks focusing on trunk flexion strength (sit up arms crossed, bilateral heel raise) and lateral trunk strength/balance were the most difficult for both SNF and CH, although there was minimal difference in the percent unable to complete each task. The major CH-SNF differences occurred in trunk elevation tasks where the upper limb was important in facilitating trunk elevation (sit up with head of bed elevation with use of arms, sit up with the use of a trapeze, or sit up with use of arms from a flat bed position). These findings suggest that to improve frail older adult performance on bed mobility tasks, and specifically in rising from supine to sitting, training should move beyond improving trunk function (i.e., trunk strength). There should be an additional focus, either through therapy or bed design modifications, on how upper limb movements and positioning can be used to assist in trunk elevation.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of motifs is one of the critical stages in studying the regulatory interactions of genes. Motifs can have complicated patterns. In particular, spaced motifs, an important class of motifs, consist of several short segments separated by spacers of different lengths. Locating spaced motifs is not trivial. Existing motif-finding algorithms are either designed for monad motifs (short contiguous patterns with some mismatches) or have assumptions on the spacer lengths or can only handle at most two segments. An effective motif finder for generic spaced motifs is highly desirable. RESULTS: This paper proposes a novel approach for identifying spaced motifs with any number of spacers of different lengths. We introduce the notion of submotifs to capture the segments in the spaced motif and formulate the motif finding problem as a frequent submotif mining problem. We provide an algorithm called SPACE to solve the problem. Based on experiments on real biological datasets, synthetic datasets and the motif assessment benchmarks by Tompa et al., we show that our algorithm performs better than existing tools for spaced motifs with improvements in both sensitivity and specificity and for monads, SPACE performs as good as other tools.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a 12-week intervention to improve the ability of disabled older adults to rise from a bed and from a chair. DESIGN: Subjects were randomly allocated to either a 12-week task-specific resistance-training intervention (training in bed- and chair-rise subtasks, such as sliding forward to the edge of a chair with the addition of weights) or a control flexibility intervention. SETTING: Seven congregate housing facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Congregate housing residents age 65 and older (n = 161, mean age 82) who reported requiring assistance (such as from a person, equipment, or device) in performing at least one of the following mobility-related activities of daily living: transferring, walking, bathing, and toileting. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, subjects performed a series of bed- and chair-rise tasks where the rise task demand varied according to height of the head of the bed, chair seat height, and use of hands. Outcomes were able or unable to rise and, if able, the time taken to rise. Logistic regression for repeated measures was used to test for differences between tasks in the ability to rise. Following log transformation of rise time, a linear effects model was used to compare rise time between tasks. RESULTS: Regarding the maximum total number of bed- and chair-rise tasks that could be successfully completed, a significant training effect was seen at 12 weeks (P = .03); the training effect decreased as the total number of tasks increased. No statistically significant training effects were noted for rise ability according to individual tasks. Bed- and chair-rise time showed a significant training effect for each rise task, with analytic models suggesting a range of approximately 11\% to 20\% rise-time (up to 1.5 seconds) improvement in the training group over controls. Training effects were also noted in musculoskeletal capacities, particularly in trunk range of motion, strength, and balance. CONCLUSIONS: Task-specific resistance training increased the overall ability and decreased the rise time required to perform a series of bed- and chair-rise tasks. The actual rise-time improvement was clinically small but may be useful over the long term. Future studies might consider adapting this exercise program and the focus on trunk function to a frailer cohort, such as in rehabilitation settings. In these settings, the less challenging rise tasks (such as rising from an elevated chair) and the ability to perform intermediate tasks (such as hip bridging) may become important intermediate rehabilitation goals.},

	abstract = {We used directed evolution to enhance the thermostability of glycosyl hydrolase family-11 xylanase from Bacillus subtilis. By combining random point mutagenesis, saturation mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling, a thermostable variant, Xyl(st), was identified which contained three amino acid substitutions: Q7H, N8F, and S179C. The half-inactivation temperature (the midpoint of the melting curves) for the Xyl(st) variant compared with the wild-type enzyme after incubation for 10 min was elevated from 58 to 68 degrees C. At 60 degrees C the wild-type enzyme was inactivated within 5 min, but Xyl(st) retained full activity for at least 2 h. The stabilization was accompanied by evidence of thermophilicity; that is, an increase in the optimal reaction temperature from 55 to 65 degrees C and lower activity at low temperatures and higher activity at higher temperatures relative to wild type. To elucidate the mechanism of thermal stabilization, three-dimensional structures were determined for the wild-type and Xyl(st) enzymes. A cavity was identified around Gln-7/Asn-8 in wild type that was filled with bulky, hydrophobic residues in Xyl(st). This site was not identified by previous approaches, but directed evolution identified the region as a weak point. Formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge via Cys-179 was observed between monomers in Xyl(st). However, the stability was essentially the same in the presence and absence of a reducing agent, indicating that the increased hydrophobicity around the Cys-179 accounted for the stability.},

	abstract = {Comparisons between human and rodent DNA sequences are widely used for the identification of regulatory regions (phylogenetic footprinting), and the importance of such intergenomic comparisons for promoter annotation is expanding. The efficacy of such comparisons for the identification of functional regulatory elements hinges on the evolutionary dynamics of promoter sequences. Although it is widely appreciated that conservation of sequence motifs may provide a suggestion of function, it is not known as to what proportion of the functional binding sites in humans is conserved in distant species. In this report, we present an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of transcription factor binding sites whose function had been experimentally verified in promoters of 51 human genes and compare their sequence to homologous sequences in other primate species and rodents. Our results show that there is extensive divergence within the nucleotide sequence of transcription factor binding sites. Using direct experimental data from functional studies in both human and rodents for 20 of the regulatory regions, we estimate that 32\%-40\% of the human functional sites are not functional in rodents. This is evidence that there is widespread turnover of transcription factor binding sites. These results have important implications for the efficacy of phylogenetic footprinting and the interpretation of the pattern of evolution in regulatory sequences.},

	abstract = {The division of genomes into distinct replication time zones has long been established. However, an in-depth understanding of their organization and their relationship to transcription is incomplete. Taking advantage of a novel synchronization method ("baby machine") and of genomic DNA microarrays, we have, for the first time, mapped replication times of the entire mouse genome at a high temporal resolution. Our data revealed that although most of the genome has a distinct time of replication either early, middle, or late S phase, a significant portion of the genome is replicated asynchronously. Analysis of the replication map revealed the genomic scale organization of the replication time zones. We found that the genomic regions between early and late replication time zones often consist of extremely large replicons. Analysis of the relationship between replication and transcription revealed that early replication is frequently correlated with the transcription potential of a gene and not necessarily with its actual transcriptional activity. These findings, along with the strong conservation found between replication timing in human and mouse genomes, emphasize the importance of replication timing in transcription regulation.},

	abstract = {Cis-regulatory sequences are not always conserved across species. Divergence within cis-regulatory sequences may result from the evolution of species-specific patterns of gene expression or the flexible nature of the cis-regulatory code. The identification of functional divergence in cis-regulatory sequences is therefore important for both understanding the role of gene regulation in evolution and annotating regulatory elements. We have developed an evolutionary model to detect the loss of constraint on individual transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We find that a significant fraction of functionally constrained binding sites have been lost in a lineage-specific manner among three closely related yeast species. Binding site loss has previously been explained by turnover, where the concurrent gain and loss of a binding site maintains gene regulation. We estimate that nearly half of all loss events cannot be explained by binding site turnover. Recreating the mutations that led to binding site loss confirms that these sequence changes affect gene expression in some cases. We also estimate that there is a high rate of binding site gain, as more than half of experimentally identified S. cerevisiae binding sites are not conserved across species. The frequent gain and loss of TFBSs implies that cis-regulatory sequences are labile and, in the absence of turnover, may contribute to species-specific patterns of gene expression.},

@article{citeulike:3978121,
	abstract = {Motivation: Motivation: Large-scale biological experiments provide snapshots into the huge number of processes running in parallel within the organism. These processes depend on a large number of (hidden) (epi)genetic, social, environmental and other factors that are out of experimentalists' control. This makes it extremely dif.cult to identify the dominant processes and the elements involved in them based on a single experiment. It is therefore desirable to use multiple sets of experiments targeting the same phenomena while differing in some experimental parameters (hidden or controllable). Although such datasets are becoming increasingly common, their analysis is complicated by the fact that the various biological elements could be in.uenced by different sets of factors.  Results: The central hypothesis of this article is that biologically related elements and processes are affected by changes in similar ways while unrelated ones are affected differently. Thus, the relations between related elements are more consistent across experiments. The method outlined here looks for groups of elements with robust intra-group relationships in the expectation that they are related. The major groups of elements may be identi.ed in this way. The strengths of relationships per se are not valued, just their consistency. This represents a completely novel and unutilized source of information. In the analysis of time course microarray experiments, I found cell cycle- and ribosome-related genes to be the major groups. Despite not looking for these groups in particular, the identi.cation of these genes rivals that of methods designed speci.cally for this purpose.

The conducted simulations vary the occurrence probability of terminal versus non-terminal symbols and study its impact on the evolutionary performance of the system. The results reveal a variant of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. A closer look at individual runs allows to discover a range of emergent evolutionary dynamics. In particular, the activation and improvement of previously dormant production rules leads to variation in the fixation rate of mutations. The corresponding fitness leaps suggest that L-system evolution derives much of its creative power from the mobilization of randomly drifting non-addressed rules.

Among the decoders of calcium signals is calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin serine/threonine phosphatase that has been involved in both short-term and long-term cellular changes. By using immortalized GnRH-secreting neurons, we now show that, in vitro, Ca2+-dependent gene expression, proceeding via calcineurin and the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells, is a key player controlling the chemomigratory potential of developing GnRH-secreting neurons. Furthermore, our data highlight the switch nature of this phosphatase, whose activation or inactivation guides cells to proceed from one genetic program to the next. 10.1210/me.2007-0277},

	abstract = {Pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus require iron to survive and have evolved specialized proteins to steal heme from their host. IsdC is the central conduit of the Isd (iron-regulated surface determinant) multicomponent heme uptake machinery; staphylococcal cell-surface proteins such as IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH are thought to funnel their molecular cargo to IsdC, which then mediates the transfer of the iron-containing nutrient to the membrane translocation system IsdDEF. The structure of the heme-IsdC complex reveals a novel heme site within an immunoglobulin-like domain and sheds light on its binding mechanism. The folding topology is reminiscent of the architecture of cytochrome f, cellobiose dehydrogenase, and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase; in these three proteins, the heme is bound in an equivalent position, but interestingly, IsdC features a distinct binding pocket with the ligand located next to the hydrophobic core of the beta-sandwich. The iron is coordinated with a tyrosine surrounded by several non-polar side chains that cluster into a tightly packed proximal side. On the other hand, the distal side is relatively exposed with a short helical peptide segment that acts as a lip clasping onto almost half of the porphyrin plane. This structural feature is argued to play a role in the mechanism of binding and release by switching to an open conformation and thus loosening the interactions holding the heme. The structure of the heme-IsdC complex provides a template for the understanding of other proteins, such as IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH, that contain the same heme-binding module as IsdC, known as the NEAT (near transporter) domain.},

	abstract = {The pathogen Staphylococcus aureus uses iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins to scavenge the essential nutrient iron from host hemoproteins. The IsdH protein (also known as HarA) is a receptor for hemoglobin (Hb), haptoglobin (Hp), and the Hb-Hp complex. It contains three NEAT (NEAr Transporter) domains: IsdH(N1), IsdH(N2), and IsdH(N3). Here we show that they have different functions; IsdH(N1) binds Hb and Hp, whereas IsdH(N3) captures heme that is released from Hb. The staphylococcal IsdB protein also functions as an Hb receptor. Primary sequence homology to IsdH indicates that it will also employ functionally distinct NEAT domains to bind heme and Hb. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance methods to localize the Hp and Hb binding surface on IsdH(N1). High affinity binding to these structurally unrelated proteins requires residues located within a conserved aromatic motif that is positioned at the end of the beta-barrel structure. Interestingly, this site is quite malleable, as other NEAT domains use it to bind heme. We also demonstrate that the IsdC NEAT domain can capture heme directly from Hb, suggesting that there are multiple pathways for heme transfer across the cell wall.},

A dominant tradition within it has striven for a positivistic and universal form of understanding, based on the individual actor. Developments in recent years have questioned our understanding of modernity, universalism, science, and the nation-state. Political science has responded in two ways: by reinforcing the positivist approach, or by adopting various forms of intepretivism. This has created an artificial division within the discipline. Political scientists can overcome this artificial divide by looking outside the discipline. There are promising developments in this direction but these are inhibited by trying to confine them within the dominant positivist mode. They have also responded by borrowing from neighbouring disciplines, but in doing so, they have too often appropriated concepts in simplified form or coined empty concepts. They need to take neighbouring disciplines more seriously and work across disciplinary boundaries. A pluralistic approach is possible, which neither seeks a grand synthesis of all the social sciences, nor sees them as independent and self-standing, but which encourages cross-fertilization and combinations of approaches. The existence of distinct European national and disciplinary traditions, far from being an obstacle to the development of the discipline, gives European political scientists an advantage.},

	abstract = {Background correction is an important preprocessing step for microarray data that attempts to adjust the data for the ambient intensity surrounding each feature. The "normexp" method models the observed pixel intensities as the sum of 2 random variables, one normally distributed and the other exponentially distributed, representing background noise and signal, respectively. Using a saddle-point approximation, Ritchie and others (2007) found normexp to be the best background correction method for 2-color microarray data. This article develops the normexp method further by improving the estimation of the parameters. A complete mathematical development is given of the normexp model and the associated saddle-point approximation. Some subtle numerical programming issues are solved which caused the original normexp method to fail occasionally when applied to unusual data sets. A practical and reliable algorithm is developed for exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using high-quality optimization software and using the saddle-point estimates as starting values. "MLE" is shown to outperform heuristic estimators proposed by other authors, both in terms of estimation accuracy and in terms of performance on real data. The saddle-point approximation is an adequate replacement in most practical situations. The performance of normexp for assessing differential expression is improved by adding a small offset to the corrected intensities. 10.1093/biostatistics/kxn042},

We are motivated by a need to test claims that quality measures are predictive of matching performance. We regard a quality measurement algorithm as a black box that converts an input sample to an output scalar. We evaluate it by quantifying the association between those values and observed matching results. We advance detection error trade-off and error versus reject characteristics as metrics for the comparative evaluation of sample quality measurement algorithms. We proceed this with a definition of sample quality, a description of the operational use of quality measures. We emphasize the performance goal by including a procedure for annotating the samples of a reference corpus with quality values derived from empirical recognition scores.},

	abstract = {Constructing a confidence interval for the actual, conditional error rate of a prediction rule from multivariate data is problematic because this error rate is not a population parameter in the traditional sense--it is a functional of the training set. When the training set changes, so does this "parameter." A valid method for constructing confidence intervals for the actual error rate had been previously developed by McLachlan. However, McLachlan's method cannot be applied in many cancer research settings because it requires the number of samples to be much larger than the number of dimensions (n >> p), and it assumes that no dimension-reducing feature selection step is performed. Here, an alternative to McLachlan's method is presented that can be applied when p >> n, with an additional adjustment in the presence of feature selection. Coverage probabilities of the new method are shown to be nominal or conservative over a wide range of scenarios. The new method is relatively simple to implement and not computationally burdensome. 10.1093/biostatistics/kxn035},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative contributions of several neurologic and biomechanic impairment mechanisms to overall finger and hand impairment in chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors. DESIGN: Repeated-measures design. SETTING: Clinical research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis. Fifteen subjects had severe hand motor impairment and 15 had moderate impairment, as measured with the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The biomechanic factors stiffness and resting flexion torque, together with the neurologic factors spasticity, strength, and coactivation, were quantified by using a custom hand manipulator, a dynamometer, and electromyographic recordings. Both passive and active rotations of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers were examined. RESULTS: Although subjects in the severely impaired group exhibited statistically greater passive stiffness and resting flexion torque than their moderately impaired counterparts (P<.05), the overall effect of these biomechanic changes appeared small in relation to the deficits attributable to neurologic changes such as spasticity and, especially, weakness. In fact, weakness in grip strength and isometric extension accounted for the greatest portion of the variance between the 2 groups (eta(2)=.40 and eta(2)=.23, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, deficits in hand motor control after stroke seem to derive mainly from weakness, which may be attributable to the loss of descending corticospinal pathway activation of motoneurons.},

	abstract = {Directed evolution was performed on vanadium chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis to increase its brominating activity at a mildly alkaline pH for industrial and synthetic applications and to further understand its mechanism. After successful expression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli, two rounds of screening and selection, saturation mutagenesis of a "hot spot," and rational recombination, a triple mutant (P395D/L241V/T343A) was obtained that showed a 100-fold increase in activity at pH 8 (kcat = 100 s-1). The increased Km values for Br- (3.1 mM) and H2O2 (16 {micro}M) are smaller than those found for vanadium bromoperoxidases that are reasonably active at this pH. In addition the brominating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 6 (kcat = 575 s-1), and the chlorinating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 2 (kcat = 36 s-1), yielding the "best" vanadium haloperoxidase known thus far. The mutations are in the first and second coordination sphere of the vanadate cofactor, and the catalytic effects suggest that fine tuning of residues Lys-353 and Phe-397, along with addition of negative charge or removal of positive charge near one of the vanadate oxygens, is very important. Lys-353 and Phe-397 were previously assigned to be essential in peroxide activation and halide binding. Analysis of the catalytic parameters of the mutant vanadium bromoperoxidase from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum also adds fuel to the discussion regarding factors governing the halide specificity of vanadium haloperoxidases. This study presents the first example of directed evolution of a vanadium enzyme. 10.1074/jbc.M512166200},

Here we have shown that IsdA has broad-spectrum ligand-binding activity, including fibrinogen and fibronectin. Mapping studies revealed a distinct domain responsible for ligand binding. This domain is present in a number of iron-regulated proteins of S. aureus and in other Gram-positive organisms. The isdA gene is only expressed in iron-limited conditions under the control of Fur and not in standard laboratory media. Such conditions occur in serum in vitro and during infection. Whole cell binding and clumping assays revealed that when the bacteria are grown under iron-limited conditions, IsdA constitutes a physiologically relevant adhesin to both fibrinogen and fibronectin. Thus for S. aureus, iron is an important marker for the host environment, to which the bacterium responds by differential regulation of at least one element of its adhesive strategy.},

SUBJECTS: Sequential sample recruited from local stroke support groups: 10 patients with chronic hemiplegia caused by cerebral vascular accident who had various degrees of spasticity in the wrist joint. OUTCOME MEASURES: Modified Ashworth Scale, amplitudes of stretch reflexes for wrist flexors, grip strength, active range of motion of the wrist joint, and Fugl-Meyer test. RESULTS: Strong reverse correlation was found between spasticity and grip strength, the Fugl-Meyer test scores, and the Box and Blocks test scores (p = .001 to .005). Results also indicated a strong and consistent correlation between spasticity and reflexive electromyographic activities of the stretch reflex recorded from active muscles (p = .005 and .007), but not between spasticity and torque response of the stretch reflex. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of wrist spasticity is associated with impaired hand function in hemiplegic patients, and hyperactive electromyographic response of the stretch reflex, recorded from active muscles, is a valid indicator of spasticity.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of genome size is a useful and necessary prerequisite for the development of many genomic resources. To better understand the origins and effects of DNA gains and losses among species, it is important to collect data from a broad taxonomic base, but also from particular ecosystems. Oceanic thermal vents are an interesting model to investigate genome size in very unstable environments. Here we provide data estimated by flow cytometry for 28 vent-living species among the most representative from different hydrothermal vents. We also report the genome size of closely related coastal decapods. Haploid C-values were compared with those previously reported for species from corresponding orders or infraorders. This is the first broad survey of 2C values in vent organisms. Contrary to expectations, it shows that certain hydrothermal vent species have particularly large genomes. The vent squat lobster Munidopsis recta has the largest genome yet reported for any anomuran: 2C = 31.1 pg = 30.4 x 109 bp. In several groups, such as Brachyura, Phyllodocida, and Veneroida, vent species have genomes that clearly rank at the high end of published values for each group. We also describe the highest DNA content yet recorded for the Brachyura (coastal crabs Xantho pilipes and Necora puber). Finally, analysis of genome size variation across populations revealed unexpected intraspecific variation in the vent shrimp Mirocaris fortunata that could not be attributed simply to ploidy changes.},

	abstract = {The ability of Staphylococcus aureus to colonize the human nares is a crucial prerequisite for disease. IsdA is a major S. aureus surface protein that is expressed during human infection and required for nasal colonization and survival on human skin. In this work, we show that IsdA binds to involucrin, loricrin, and cytokeratin K10, proteins that are present in the cornified envelope of human desquamated epithelial cells. To measure the forces and dynamics of the interaction between IsdA and loricrin (the most abundant protein of the cornified envelope), single-molecule force spectroscopy was used, demonstrating high-specificity binding. IsdA acts as a cellular adhesin to the human ligands, promoting whole-cell binding to immobilized proteins, even in the absence of other S. aureus components (as shown by heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis). Inhibition experiments revealed the binding of the human ligands to the same IsdA region. This region was mapped to the NEAT domain of IsdA. The NEAT domain also was found to be required for S. aureus whole-cell binding to the ligands as well as to human nasal cells. Thus, IsdA is an important adhesin to human ligands, which predominate in its primary ecological niche.},

@article{citeulike:4871606,
	abstract = {Recently, clustering of inertial particles in turbulence has been thoroughly analysed for statistically homogeneous isotropic flows. Phenomenologically, spatial homogeneity of particle configurations is broken by the advection of a range of eddies determined by the Stokes relaxation time of the particles. This in turn results in a multi-scale distribution of local particle concentration and voids. Much less is known concerning anisotropic flows. Here, by addressing direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a statistically steady particle-laden homogeneous shear flow, we provide evidence that the mean shear preferentially orients particle patterns. By imprinting anisotropy on large-scale velocity fluctuations, the shear indirectly affects the geometry of the clusters. Quantitative evaluation is provided by a purposely designed tool, the angular distribution function (ADF) of particle pairs, which allows to address the anisotropy content of particle aggregates on a scale-by-scale basis. The data provide evidence that, depending on the Stokes relaxation time of the particles, anisotropic clustering may occur even in the range of scales in which the carrier phase velocity field is already recovering isotropy. The strength of the singularity in the anisotropic component of the ADF quantifies the level of fine-scale anisotropy, which may even reach values of more than 30\% direction-dependent variation in the probability to find two closeby particles at viscous-scale separation.},

ESAT-6 is transported across the bacterial envelope by a specialized secretion system with a FSD (FtsK-SpoIIIE domain) membrane protein. Although the presence of ESAT-6-like genes has been identified in the genomes of other microbes, the possibility that they may encode general virulence functions has hitherto not been addressed. Herein we show that the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus secretes EsxA and EsxB, ESAT-6-like proteins, across the bacterial envelope. Staphylococcal esxA and esxB are clustered with six other genes and some of these are required for synthesis or secretion of EsxA and EsxB. Mutants that failed to secrete EsxA and EsxB displayed defects in the pathogenesis of S. aureus murine abscesses, suggesting that this specialized secretion system may be a general strategy of human bacterial pathogenesis.},

We develop a web server for the recognition of DNA binding sites based on variable order Markov models and variable order Bayesian trees offering the following functionality: (i) given datasets with annotated binding sites and genomic background sequences, variable order Markov models and variable order Bayesian trees can be trained; (ii) given a set of trained models, putative DNA binding sites can be predicted in a given set of genomic sequences and (iii) given a dataset with annotated binding sites and a dataset with genomic background sequences, cross-validation experiments for different model combinations with different parameter settings can be performed. Several of the offered services are computationally demanding, such as genome-wide predictions of DNA binding sites in mammalian genomes or sets of 10(4)-fold cross-validation experiments for different model combinations based on problem-specific data sets.

	abstract = {In an analysis of the resistance mechanisms of an mgrA mutant, we identified two genes encoding previously undescribed transporters, NorB and Tet38. norB was 1,392 bp and encoded a predicted 49-kDa protein. When overexpressed, NorB led to an increase in resistance to hydrophilic quinolones, ethidium bromide, and cetrimide and also to sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin, and tetracycline, a resistance phenotype of the mgrA mutant. NorA and NorB shared 30\% similarity, and NorB shared 30 and 41\% similarities with the Bmr and Blt transporters of Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The second efflux pump was a more selective transporter that we have called Tet38, which had 46\% similarity with the plasmid-encoded TetK efflux transporter of S. aureus. tet38 was 1,353 bp and encoded a predicted 49-kDa protein. Overexpression of tet38 produced resistance to tetracycline but not to minocycline and other drugs. norB and tet38 transcription was negatively regulated by MgrA. Limited binding of MgrA to the promoter regions of norB and tet38 was demonstrated by gel shift assays, suggesting that MgrA was an indirect regulator of norB and tet38 expression. The mgrA norB double mutant was reproducibly twofold more susceptible to the tested quinolones than the mgrA mutant. The mgrA tet38 double mutant became more susceptible to tetracycline than the wild-type parent strain. These data demonstrate that overexpression of NorB and Tet38 contribute, respectively, to the hydrophobic quinolone resistance and the tetracycline resistance of the mgrA mutant and that MgrA regulates expression of norB and tet38 in addition to its role in regulation of norA expression.},

@article{citeulike:4871581,
	abstract = {Prostate cancer is the commonest non-skin cancer in men. Incidence and mortality rates of this tumor vary strikingly throughout the world. Although several factors have been implicated to explain this remarkable variation, lifestyle and dietary factors may play a dominant role, with sex hormones behaving as intermediaries between exogenous factors and molecular targets in development and progression of prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer is generally considered a paradigm of androgen-dependent tumor; however, estrogen role in both normal and malignant prostate appears to be equally important. The association between plasma androgens and prostate cancer remains contradictory and mostly not compatible with the androgen hypothesis. Similar evidence apply to estrogens, although the ratio of androgen to estrogen in plasma declines with age. Apart from methodological problems, a major issue is to what extent circulating hormones can be considered representative of their intraprostatic levels. Both nontumoral and malignant human prostate tissues and cells are endowed with key enzymes of steroid metabolism, including 17betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17betaHSD), 5beta-reductase, 3alpha/3betaHSD, and aromatase. A divergent expression and/or activity of these enzymes may eventually lead to a differential prostate accumulation of steroid derivatives having distinct biological activities, as it occurs for hydroxylated estrogens in the human breast. Locally produced or metabolically transformed estrogens may differently affect proliferative activity of prostate cancer cells. Aberrant aromatase expression and activity has been reported in prostate tumor tissues and cells, implying that androgen aromatization to estrogens may play a role in prostate carcinogenesis or tumor progression. Interestingly, many genes encoding for steroid enzymes are polymorphic, although only a few studies have supported their relation with risk of prostate cancer. In animal model systems estrogens, combined with androgens, appear to be required for the malignant transformation of prostate epithelial cells. Although the mechanisms underlying the hormonal induction of prostate cancer in experimental animals remain uncertain, there is however evidence to support the assumption that long term administration of androgens and estrogens results in an estrogenic milieu in rat prostates and in the ensuing development of dysplasia and cancer. Both androgen and estrogen have been reported to stimulate proliferation of cultured prostate cancer cells, primarily through receptor-mediated effects. As for estrogens, the two major receptor types, ERalpha and ERbeta, are expressed in both normal and diseased human prostate, though with a different cellular localization. Since these two receptors are different in terms of ligand binding, heterodimerization, transactivation, and estrogen response element activity, it is likely that an imbalance of their expression may be critical to determine the ultimate estrogen effects on prostate cancer cells. In prostate cancer, ERbeta activation appears to limit cell proliferation directly or through ERalpha inhibition, and loss of ERbeta has been consistently associated with tumor progression. Several splicing variants of both ERalpha and ERbeta exist. Little is known about their expression and function in the human prostate, although reciprocal regulation and interaction with gene promoter both warrant further investigation. In summary, although multiple consistent evidence suggests that estrogens are critical players in human prostate cancer, their role has been only recently reconsidered, being eclipsed for years by an androgen-dominated interest.},

confinement and of the deconfinement phase transition at some critical
temperature, the Yang--Mills theory is formulated and studied at nonzero
temperatures. We introduce ``calorons with a nontrivial holonomy'' that are
generalizations of instantons and can be viewed as ``made of'' constituent
dyons. The quantum weight with which these calorons contribute to the
Yang--Mills partition function is considered, and the ensuing statistical
mechanics of the ensemble of interacting dyons is discussed. We argue that a
simple semiclassical picture based on dyons satisfies all known criteria of
confinement and explains the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. This
refers not only to the SU(N) gauge groups where dyons lead to the expected
behaviour of the observables with N, but also to the exceptional G(2) group
whose group center, unlike SU(N), is trivial. Despite being centerless, the
G(2) gauge group possesses confinement at low temperatures, and a 1st order
deconfinement transition, according to several latest lattice simulations,
indicating that confinement-deconfinement is not related to the group center.
Dyons, however, reproduce this behaviour.},

A consistent analysis over diverse student populations in high schools, colleges, and universities is obtained if a rough measure of the average effectiveness of a course in promoting conceptual understanding is taken to be the average normalized gain g. The latter is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain (\%post–\%pre) to the maximum possible average gain (100–\%pre). Fourteen "traditional" (T) courses (N = 2084) which made little or no use of interactive-engagement (IE) methods achieved an average gain gT-ave = 0.23±0.04 (std dev). In sharp contrast, 48 courses (N = 4458) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain gIE-ave = 0.48±0.14 (std dev), almost two standard deviations of gIE-ave above that of the traditional courses. Results for 30 (N = 3259) of the above 62 courses on the problem-solving Mechanics Baseline test of Hestenes–Wells imply that IE strategies enhance problem-solving ability.

	abstract = {10.1177/0363546508330147 Functional ankle instability (FAI) may be prevalent in as many as 40\% of patients after acute lateral ankle sprain. Altered afference resulting from damaged mechanoreceptors after an ankle sprain may lead to reflex inhibition of surrounding joint musculature. This activation deficit, referred to as arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), may be the underlying cause of FAI. Incomplete activation could prevent adequate control of the ankle joint, leading to repeated episodes of instability. Arthrogenic muscle inhibition is present in the peroneal musculature of functionally unstable ankles and is related to dynamic peroneal muscle activity. Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Twenty-one (18 female, 3 male) patients with unilateral FAI and 21 (18 female, 3 male) uninjured, matched controls participated in this study. Peroneal maximum H-reflexes and M-waves were recorded bilaterally to establish the presence or absence of AMI, while electromyography (EMG) recorded as patients underwent a sudden ankle inversion perturbation during walking was used to quantify dynamic activation. The H:M ratio and average EMG amplitudes were calculated and used in data analyses. Two-way analyses of variance were used to compare limbs and groups. A regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between the H:M ratio and the EMG amplitudes. The FAI patients had larger peroneal H:M ratios in their nonpathological ankle (0.399 ± 0.185) than in their pathological ankle (0.323 ± 0.161) ( = .036), while no differences were noted between the ankles of the controls (0.442 ± 0.176 and 0.425 ± 0.180). The FAI patients also exhibited lower EMG after inversion perturbation in their pathological ankle (1.7 ± 1.3) than in their uninjured ankle (EMG, 3.3 ± 3.1) ( < .001), while no differences between legs were noted for controls ( > .05). No significant relationship was found between the peroneal H:M ratio and peroneal EMG ( > .05). Arthrogenic muscle inhibition is present in the peroneal musculature of persons with FAI but is not related to dynamic muscle activation as measured by peroneal EMG amplitude. Reversing AMI may not assist in protecting the ankle from further episodes of instability; however dynamic muscle activation (as measured by peroneal EMG amplitude) should be restored to maximize ankle stabilization. Dynamic peroneal activity is impaired in functionally unstable ankles, which may contribute to recurrent joint instability and may leave the ankle vulnerable to injurious loads.},

	abstract = {Short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome provide a DNA barcode for identifying species. Compiling a public library of DNA barcodes linked to named specimens could provide a new master key for identifying species, one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster, cheaper sequencing. Recent work suggests that sequence diversity in a 648-bp region of the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), might serve as a DNA barcode for the identification of animal species. This study tested the effectiveness of a COI barcode in discriminating bird species, one of the largest and best-studied vertebrate groups. We determined COI barcodes for 260 species of North American birds and found that distinguishing species was generally straightforward. All species had a different COI barcode(s), and the differences between closely related species were, on average, 18 times higher than the differences within species. Our results identified four probable new species of North American birds, suggesting that a global survey will lead to the recognition of many additional bird species. The finding of large COI sequence differences between, as compared to small differences within, species confirms the effectiveness of COI barcodes for the identification of bird species. This result plus those from other groups of animals imply that a standard screening threshold of sequence difference (10x average intraspecific difference) could speed the discovery of new animal species. The growing evidence for the effectiveness of DNA barcodes as a basis for species identification supports an international exercise that has recently begun to assemble a comprehensive library of COI sequences linked to named specimens.},

Huang and D. Beauchemin, J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2006, 21, 317-320 and C. Huang, D. Beauchemin, J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2006, 21, 1419-1422).1,2 It involves the separation of a metal complex from the free metal ion by ion exchange with on-line detection of eluting metal-containing species by ICP-MS. The relative amounts of the complexed and free metals were simply obtained from the area of the corresponding peaks in the time-resolved chromatograms. A plot of the logarithm of the peak area ratio of the complex over the free metal as a function of the logarithm of the analytical concentration of the ligand gave log Kf[prime or minute] as the intercept and the chelation number, n, as the slope. Although this method was demonstrated to allow the accurate determination of the conditional stability constant of a simple system (EDTA complexes of Co and Zn),1,2 the corresponding chelation numbers were significantly off from the expected unity value. A close scrutiny of the method revealed the main source of the discrepancy: it assumed that the ligand was in excess, which was not the case. Furthermore, it neglected other complexes than that with EDTA4-, such as those with HEDTA3-, H2EDTA2-, etc. In this work, no asuumption is made and a linear regression of the logarithm of the peak area ratio of the complex over the free metal versus the logarithm of the concentration of the uncomplexed chelating reagent is shown to accurately give both log Kf[prime or minute] as the intercept and the chelation number as the slope. This revised method was successfully applied to Co-EDTA and Zn-EDTA complex systems with 0.1 M NH4NO3 as the supporting electrolyte.},

BISTRO was developed for the purpose of accomplishing band-selective signal removal, as in water suppression and outer-volume suppression (OVS), in applications requiring the use of an inhomogeneous RF transmitter, such as a surface coil. In the present work, Bloch simulations were used to illustrate the principles and theoretical performance of BISTRO. Its performance for OVS was evaluated experimentally using MRI and spectroscopic imaging of phantoms and in vivo animal and human brain. By using FM pulses featuring offset-independent adiabaticity, BISTRO permitted high-quality, broadband suppression with one (or two) discrete borders demarcating the edge(s) of the suppression band. Simulations and experiments demonstrated the ability to operate BISTRO with reasonably attainable peak RF power levels and with average RF energy deposition similar to other multipulse OVS techniques.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous capability of a method for the determination of conditional stability constants (Kf[prime or minute]) by ion chromatography (IC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is demonstrated through its application to the complexation of Zn and Co by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The approach simply involved separation of the free metal ions and their EDTA complexes by an anion-exchange guard column (Dionex AG-7, 4 [times] 50 mm), using a 0.1 M NH4NO3 mobile phase at pH 3.81. This column exhibited cation-exchange properties at this pH, i.e. the complexes eluted first, followed by the free metals. Because ICP-MS was used for detection of the metal species, only a separation of each metal cation from its anionic complex was required, the different elements being detected separately by ICP-MS. Hence, a guard column was sufficient, which kept the analysis time short and minimised instrument drift from the continuous aspiration of 0.1 M (or 0.8\%) NH4NO3. A plot of log(peak area of complex/peak area of free metal) versus log(total free EDTA concentration), for a series of solutions containing Co, Zn and a range of EDTA concentrations, yielded straight lines. The resulting intercepts, which corresponded to log Kf[prime or minute], were 7.77 +/- 0.39 and 7.47 +/- 0.25 for Zn-EDTA2- and Co-EDTA2-, respectively, in good agreement with the expected values.},

@article{citeulike:4871553,
	abstract = {Different approaches for parameterizing the effects of vertical variability of cloudiness on radiative transfer are assessed using a database constructed from observations derived from lidar and millimeter cloud radar data collected from three different locations. Five different methods for dealing with the vertical overlap of clouds were incorporated into a single radiation model that was applied to the lidar/radar data averaged in time. The calculated fluxes and heating rates derived with this model are compared to broadband fluxes and heating rates calculated with the independent column approximation using the time-resolved cloud data. These comparisons provide a way of evaluating the effects of different overlap assumptions on the calculation of domain-mean fluxes. It was demonstrated how two of the most commonly used overlap schemes, the random and maximum-random methods, suffer a severe problem in that the total cloud amount defined by these methods depends on the vertical resolution of the host model thus creating a vertical-resolution-dependent bias in model total cloudiness and radiative fluxes. A new method is introduced to overcome this problem by preserving the total column cloud amount. Despite these problems, the comparisons presented show that most methods introduce a relatively small bias with respect to the single-column data. This is largely a consequence of the nature of the cloud cover statistics associated with the lidar/radar observations used in this study and might not apply in general. Among the three best-performing methods (random, overcast random, and maximum random), the more commonly used maximum-random method does not perform significantly better than the other two methods with regard to both bias and rms error despite its relative high computational cost. The comparisons also reveal the nature and magnitude of the random errors that are introduced by the subgrid-scale parameterizations. These random errors are large and an inevitable consequence of the parameterization process that treats cloud structure statistically. These errors may be thought of as a source of noise to the general circulation model in which the parameterization is embedded.},

	abstract = {To develop and investigate detailed mathematical models of metabolic processes is one of the primary challenges in systems biology. However, despite considerable advance in the topological analysis of metabolic networks, kinetic modeling is still often severely hampered by inadequate knowledge of the enzyme-kinetic rate laws and their associated parameter values. Here we propose a method that aims to give a quantitative account of the dynamical capabilities of a metabolic system, without requiring any explicit information about the functional form of the rate equations. Our approach is based on constructing a local linear model at each point in parameter space, such that each element of the model is either directly experimentally accessible or amenable to a straightforward biochemical interpretation. This ensemble of local linear models, encompassing all possible explicit kinetic models, then allows for a statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space. The method is exemplified on two paradigmatic metabolic systems: the glycolytic pathway of yeast and a realistic-scale representation of the photosynthetic Calvin cycle. 10.1073/pnas.0600013103},

The analysis focuses on the theo-political ideology of Christian Zionism and its roles and manifestations in the context of evangelical pilgrimages to Israel. Findings suggest that ideological dynamics within the development of these tours can be discussed by distinguishing between four tourism actors, namely, ideological organizations, tour organizers, Israeli officials, and the tourists. We suggest that these actors can be differentiated from each other in accordance with their ideological roles and orientations. Additionally, by demonstrating the similar utilization of pilgrimage by theo-political opponents of Christian Zionism, such as Sabeel and FOSNA, this article illustrates how pilgrimage to the Holy Land has become an arena for competition between these two rival ideologies within the Evangelical movement. The article concludes with a discussion on the role of pilgrimages to Israel as a platform through which theo-political ideologies are manifested, distributed, utilized, and consumed.},

To understand the associated functional neuroanatomy of this belief-bias we studied 14 volunteers using event-related fMRI, as they performed reasoning tasks under neutral, facilitatory and inhibitory belief conditions. We found evidence for the engagement of a left temporal lobe system during belief-based reasoning and a bilateral parietal lobe system during belief-neutral reasoning. Activation of right lateral prefrontal cortex was evident when subjects inhibited a prepotent response associated with belief-bias and correctly completed a logical task, a finding consistent with its putative role in cognitive monitoring. By contrast, when logical reasoning was overcome by belief-bias, there was engagement of ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in affective processing. This latter involvement suggests that belief-bias effects in reasoning may be mediated through an influence of emotional processes on reasoning.},

We report on multiple aspects of the dataset and synthesized graph. We find that the graph is well-connected and robust to node removal. We investigate on a planetary-scale the oft-cited report that people are separated by "six degrees of separation" and find that the average path length among Messenger users is 6.6. We find that people tend to communicate more with each other when they have similar age, language, and location, and that cross-gender conversations are both more frequent and of longer duration than conversations with the same gender.},

We simulated scroll wave behaviors in a three-dimensional cardiac tissue model, using phase I of the Luo-Rudy (LR1) action potential model. The effects of action potential duration (APD) restitution, tissue thickness, filament twist, and fiber rotation were studied. We found that APD restitution is the major determinant of scroll wave behavior and that instabilities arising from APD restitution are the main determinants of scroll wave breakup in this cardiac model. We did not see a "thickness-induced instability" in the LR1 model, but a minimum thickness is required for scroll breakup in the presence of fiber rotation. The major effect of fiber rotation is to maintain twist in a scroll wave, promoting filament bending and thus scroll breakup. In addition, fiber rotation induces curvature in the scroll wave, which weakens conduction and further facilitates wave break.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This is part 2 of a 2-part review. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the various aspects of prostate cancer (PCa) requires the use of in vivo and in vitro model systems. In the last few years many new cell lines have been established by investigators from primary tissue sources and clonal derivatives of previously established lines. Therefore, the purpose of this 2-part review is to catalogue the current human cell lines developed for PCa research, as reported in the literature. Part 2 describes tissue culture cell lines derived by the insertion of transgenes, including human telomerase reverse transcriptase, SV40 T antigen and human papillomavirus genes. Part 2 also includes xenograft lines that require propagation and passage in vivo in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostate cell lines included in this review were identified by extensive searching of the literature using several strategies, including PubMed searches and book chapter reviews. RESULTS: In total we describe the derivation, phenotype, genotype and characterization of molecular markers expressed by approximately 200 lines and sublines used in PCa research, including ones derived from primary tumors, metastases and normal prostate tissue. We paid particular attention to the expression of prostate specific antigen, androgen receptor, cytokeratins and other molecular markers used to indicate the status of PCa and the prostatic lineage of a given line. In an attempt to provide PCa researchers with a resource of information regarding new and established cell lines we have also created an online database of these PCa cell lines freely accessible via the World Wide Web at http://www.CaPCellLines.com. The web based interface allows researchers to peruse and print information regarding cell lines, add new cell lines and update or add new information regarding established cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: This compendium of cell lines currently used in PCa research combined with access to our on-line database provides researchers with a continually updated and valuable resource for investigating the molecular mechanisms of PCa.},

	abstract = {A key question for cognitive theories of reasoning is whether logical reasoning is inherently a sentential linguistic process or a process requiring spatial manipulation and search. We addressed this question in an event-related fMRI study of syllogistic reasoning, using sentences with and without semantic content. Our findings indicate involvement of two dissociable networks in deductive reasoning. During content-based reasoning a left hemisphere temporal system was recruited. By contrast, a formally identical reasoning task, which lacked semantic content, activated a parietal system. The two systems share common components in bilateral basal ganglia nuclei, right cerebellum, bilateral fusiform gyri, and left prefrontal cortex. We conclude that syllogistic reasoning is implemented in two distinct systems whose engagement is primarily a function of the presence or absence of semantic content. Furthermore, when a logical argument results in a belief-logic conflict, the nature of the reasoning process is changed by recruitment of the right prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {While remaining a major problem in hospitals, Staphylococcus aureus is now spreading in communities. Strain MW2 (USA400 lineage) and other community methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains most commonly cause skin infections with abscess formation. Multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps contribute to antimicrobial resistance but may also contribute to bacterial survival by removal of environmental toxins. In S. aureus, NorA, NorB, NorC, and Tet38 are chromosomally encoded efflux pumps whose overexpression can confer MDR to quinolones and other compounds (Nor pumps) or tetracyclines alone (Tet38), but the natural substrates of these pumps are not known. To determine the role of these efflux pumps in a natural environment in the absence of antibiotics, we used strain MW2 in a mouse subcutaneous abscess model and compared pump gene expression as determined by reverse transcription-PCR in the abscesses and in vitro. norB and tet38 were selectively upregulated in vivo more than 171- and 24-fold, respectively, whereas norA and norC were downregulated. These changes were associated with an increase in expression of mgrA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator known to affect pump gene expression. In competition experiments using equal inocula of a norB or tet38 mutant and parent strain MW2, each mutant exhibited growth defects of about two- to threefold in vivo. In complementation experiments, a single-copy insertion of norB (but not a single-copy insertion of tet38) in the attB site within geh restored the growth fitness of the norB mutant in vivo. Our findings indicate that some MDR pumps, like NorB, can facilitate bacterial survival when they are overexpressed in a staphylococcal abscess and may contribute to the relative resistance of abscesses to antimicrobial therapy, thus linking bacterial fitness and resistance in vivo.},

	abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by reward or sensory stimuli predicting reward. These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward-predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopamine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar anatomical difference was observed for their responses to actual airpuffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the pattern of use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in a UK region, where National Health Service policy does not recommend screening for prostate cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data were collected on all PSA tests in Northern Ireland between 1990 and 1999. Annual rates of PSA testing were calculated by age, GP Practice and year. RESULTS: In all, 165 862 PSA tests were performed on 84 669 men, and over a third of men aged > or = 50 years had at least one PSA test. Men aged < 50 years accounted for 12.9\% of first tests. The proportion of tests from primary care increased from 47.2\% in 1993 to 67.0\% in 1999. The mean age of men tested once decreased from 65.6 to 61.9 years (P trend < 0.001) and the proportion with an elevated PSA level also declined during the period. Repeat testing increased with PSA level (P < 0.001) but 29.4\% of men with a PSA level of < or = 4 ng/mL also had repeat testing. Raised PSA values were more common from hospital than primary care (32.4\% vs 20.6\%, P < 0.001) and in older men. Test rates varied 100-fold across general practices, a finding not explained by sociodemographic factors, but one which reflects differential adherence to national guidelines, suggesting that general practitioners are key targets for attempting to rationalise the use of the PSA test. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PSA screening is taking place against evidence-based advice and has resulted in over 20 000 men being designated as having a raised PSA level, creating a need for further assessment.},

We demonstrate here that the state of histone acetylation of surrounding chromatin is an important regulator of temporal firing. Deletion of  RPD3  histone deacetylase causes earlier origin firing and concurrent binding of the replication factor Cdc45p to origins. In addition, increased acetylation of histones in the vicinity of the late origin  ARS1412  by recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p causes  ARS1412  alone to fire earlier.

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an XML-based hierarchical QoS markup language, called HQML, to enhance distributed multimedia applications on the World Wide Web (WWW) with quality of service (QoS) capability. The design of HQML  is based on two observations: (1) the absence of a systematic QoS specification language, that can be used by distributed multimedia applications on the WWW to utilize the state-of-the-art QoS management technology and (2) the power and popularity of XML to deliver richly structured contents over the Web. HQML allows distributed multimedia applications to specify all kinds of application-specific QoS policies and requirements. During runtime, the  HQML Executor  translates the HQML file into desired data structures and cooperates with the  QoS proxies  that assist applications in end-to-end QoS negotiation, setup and enforcement. In order to make QoS services tailored toward user preferences and meet the challenges of uncertainty in the distributed heterogeneous environments, the design of HQML is featured as  interactive  and flexible  . In order to allow application developers to create HQML specifications correctly and easily, we have designed and developed a unified visual QoS programming environment, called  QoSTalk . In  QoSTalk , we adopt a grammatical approach to perform consistency check on the visual QoS specifications and generate HQML files automatically. Finally, we introduce the  distributed QoS compiler , which performs the automatic mappings between application- and resource-level QoS parameters to relieve the application developer of the burden of dealing with low-level QoS specifications. },

The tunnel junction is divided into three regions of complex dielectric function ε L (ω); ε 0 (ω); and ε R (ω) which correspond to the left electrode; the barrier; and the right electrode; respectively. Maxwell's equations are solved for the classical electromagnetic fields. The source terms are given by the quantum-mechanical transition current and charge; J→=( ie ℏ    /    2 m )(ψ * R ∇ψ L -ψ L ∇ψ * R ) and ρ=- e ψ * R ψ L ; for an electronic transition from a state ψ L  in the left electrode to a state ψ R  in the right. The transition rate is given by (-2    /    ℏω)Re∫E→ * ·J→ d 3 r  where ℏω= E L - E R . This new formulation avoids the need to quantize the electromagnetic fields and allows the use of complex dielectric functions. Current-carrying orthogonal eigenfunctions are used for ψ L  and ψ R  in place of the nonorthogonal basis set associated with the transfer-Hamiltonian theory of inelastic tunneling. The transition rate calculated from the latter theory differs from the present calculation by a factor as large as 10 to 100 in some instances. Numerical estimates of the rate of surface-plasmon excitation in Al-Al 2 O 3 -Ag junctions are given. The inelastic tunneling rate is found to be ∼0.1 of the elastic rate (for electrons tunneling into Ag). Excitation of electromagnetic modes which can be made radiative by roughening the electrodes is discussed.},

	abstract = {Saline groundwater and irrigation drainage are commonly diverted and stored in both natural and artificial depressions throughout the Murray–Darling Basin of Australia. The disposal basin brines that are formed are often denser than ambient groundwater. Under certain conditions these dense brines may become unstable causing them to mix with groundwater over distances several orders of magnitude greater than due to diffusion alone. A model is developed to study the mixed convection processes below a saline disposal basin located between a recharge and discharge zone. Numerical simulations are performed in cross-section using the 2-D density dependent model SUTRA (saturated–unsaturated transport). It is shown that the salt front movement is related to both the ability of the dense saline brines to mix convectively with underlying groundwaters (Rayleigh convection) and the strength of the regional advective velocity. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifer systems are studied and the effects of anisotropy are considered. Our numerical results suggest that the behaviour of a dense brine plume overlying less dense groundwater in a homogeneous porous medium depends on the magnitude of at least two non-dimensional numbers, a Rayleigh number and modified Peclet number, defined in terms of basin scale hydrogeologic parameters including dispersion. It is shown that the onset of gravitational instabilities and the formation of free convective cells begins when the magnitude of a non-dimensional parameter combining the Rayleigh and modified Peclet number exceeds a certain critical value. {\copyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the main issues is the heterogeneity of QoS information coming from d sources: clients, communication networks, servers, data . etc. In the context of quality-driven delivery (QDD) referring to the ability of a system to deliver data objects while considering the end-users expectations, all components of a distributed multimedia system have to contribute to satisfy users requirements. The mapping activity is therefore essential for dealing with the variety of QoS information of these components.

Each sensor makes a binary decision based on its own measurement, and the local decision of each sensor is sent to a fusion center using a random access protocol. The fusion center decides whether the event has occurred under a global size constraint in the Neyman-Pearson formulation. Assuming homogeneous Poisson distributed sensors, we show that the distribution of "alarmed" sensors satisfies the local asymptotic normality (LAN). We then derive an asymptotically locally most powerful (ALMP) detector optimized jointly over the fusion form and the local sensor threshold under the Poisson regime. We establish conditions on the spatial signal shape that ensure the existence of the ALMP detector. We show that the ALMP test statistic is a weighted sum of local decisions, the optimal weights being the shape of the spatial signal; the exact value of the signal strength is not required. We also derive the optimal threshold for each sensor. For the case of independent, identically distributed (iid) sensor observations, we show that the counting-based detector is also ALMP under the Poisson regime. The performance of the proposed detector is evaluated through analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations and compared with that of the counting-based detector. The effect of mismatched signal shapes is also investigated.},

	abstract = {Forty-three years ago, Douglas McGregor's The Human Side of Enterprise offered managers a new assumption of management (Theory Y), which would be more effective than what he considered then-current management assumptions (Theory X). While McGregor's Theory Y model has been widely adopted in management literature as the preferred model, Theory X management still persists in practice. Moreover, many efforts to introduce management initiatives based on Theory Y have failed to reform the workplace or worker attitudes. While most explanations of these failures focus on training, implementation, or sabotage, this article proposes several defects in Theory Y that have contributed to these failures. Theory Y is based upon an incomplete theory of human motivation that erroneously assumes that all people are creative (and want to be creative) in the same way. Important research by Michael Kirton presents a different model of creativity that explains the failure of Theory Y and justifies Theory X as an important managerial theory and strategy. Theory X persists not because of circumstances or the nature of particular jobs, but because different people have personalities that respond to Theory X management better than to Theory Y management. 10.1093/jopart/mug022},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe majority of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions of the 5'-untranslated region of the androgen-regulated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) promoter with erythroblast transformation-specific transcription factor family members. The common fusion between TMPRESS2 and v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) (ERG) is associated with a more aggressive clinical phenotype, implying the existence of a distinct subclass of prostate cancer defined by this fusion.  MethodsWe used complementary DNA-mediated annealing, selection, ligation, and extension to determine the expression profiles of 6144 transcriptionally informative genes in archived biopsy samples from 455 prostate cancer patients in the Swedish Watchful Waiting cohort (1987-1999) and the United States-based Physicians' Health Study cohort (1983-2003). A gene expression signature for prostate cancers with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was determined using partitioning and classification models and used in computational functional analysis. Cell proliferation and TMPRSS2-ERG expression in androgen receptor-negative (NCI-H660) prostate cancer cells after treatment with vehicle or estrogenic compounds were assessed by viability assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.  ResultsWe identified an 87-gene expression signature that distinguishes TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancer as a discrete molecular entity (area under the curve = 0.80, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.792 to 0.81; P < .001). Computational analysis suggested that this fusion signature was associated with estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. Viability of NCI-H660 cells decreased after treatment with estrogen (viability normalized to day 0, estrogen vs vehicle at day 8, mean = 2.04 vs 3.40, difference = 1.36, 95\% CI = 1.12 to 1.62) or ER{beta} agonist (ER{beta} agonist vs vehicle at day 8, mean = 1.86 vs 3.40, difference = 1.54, 95\% CI = 1.39 to 1.69) but increased after ER{alpha} agonist treatment (ER{alpha} agonist vs vehicle at day 8, mean = 4.36 vs 3.40, difference = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.68 to 1.23). Similarly, expression of TMPRSS2-ERG decreased after ER{beta} agonist treatment (fold change over internal control, ER{beta} agonist vs vehicle at 24 hours, NCI-H660, mean = 0.57- vs 1.0-fold, difference = 0.43-fold, 95\% CI = 0.29- to 0.57-fold) and increased after ER{alpha} agonist treatment (ER{alpha} agonist vs vehicle at 24 hours, mean = 5.63- vs 1.0-fold, difference = 4.63-fold, 95\% CI = 4.34- to 4.92-fold).

quantum gravity has revealed a deep analogy between the two. General relativity
makes heavy use of the category nCob, whose objects are (n-1)-dimensional
manifolds representing "space" and whose morphisms are n-dimensional cobordisms
representing "spacetime". Quantum theory makes heavy use of the category Hilb,
whose objects are Hilbert spaces used to describe "states", and whose morphisms
are bounded linear operators used to describe "processes". Moreover, the
categories nCob and Hilb resemble each other far more than either resembles
Set, the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions. In
particular, both Hilb and nCob but not Set are *-categories with a noncartesian
monoidal structure. We show how this accounts for many of the famously puzzling
features of quantum theory: the failure of local realism, the impossibility of
duplicating quantum information, and so on. We argue that these features only
seem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb as analogous to Set rather than nCob,
so that quantum theory will make more sense when regarded as part of a theory
of spacetime.},

@article{chamberland:03:dcs,
	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a binary decentralized detection problem in which a network of wireless sensors provides relevant information about the state of nature to a fusion center. Each sensor transmits its data over a multiple access channel. Upon reception of the information, the fusion center attempts to accurately reconstruct the state of nature. We consider the scenario where the sensor network is constrained by the capacity of the wireless channel over which the sensors are transmitting, and we study the structure of an optimal sensor configuration. For the problem of detecting deterministic signals in additive Gaussian noise, we show that having a set of identical binary sensors is asymptotically optimal, as the number of observations per sensor goes to infinity. Thus, the gain offered by having more sensors exceeds the benefits of getting detailed information from each sensor. A thorough analysis of the Gaussian case is presented along with some extensions to other observation distributions.},

	abstract = {Quorum sensing is a common mechanism used by bacteria to coordinate population behavior, and is involved in a variety of biological processes, such as bioluminescence, virulence factor synthesis, antibiotic production, and biofilm formation. To engineer the LuxI enzyme of the LuxI-LuxR quorum-sensing system, we developed a high throughput genetic selection to identify LuxI mutants with improved OHHL (3-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone) synthesis in E. coli. Using this genetic selection, we created LuxI mutants with improved OHHL synthesis rates and yields through directed evolution, identifying three LuxI mutants after two generations. An in vivo semi-quantitative method allowed for verification of the genetic screen and OHHL yields were quantified using HPLC-MS/MS, revealing an 80-fold increase in a mutant culture compared to the wildtype culture. In addition to OHHL, the yields of C6HSL (hexanoyl homoserine lactone) and C8HSL (octanoyl homoserine lactone) were also improved, and a slight change in substrate specificity towards C6HSL production was observed. Based on alignment with the crystal structure of EsaI, a homolog of LuxI, two mutations are most likely involved in enhancing the interactions between the enzyme and the substrates. The high throughput genetic selection and the semi-quantitative method can be conveniently modified for the directed evolution of LuxI homologs. The identification of these LuxI mutants has implications in synthetic biology, where they can be used for the construction of artificial genetic circuits. In addition, development of drugs that specifically target quorum sensing to attenuate the pathogenesis of gram-negative infectious bacteria might also benefit from the insights into the molecular mechanism of quorum sensing revealed by the amino acid substitutions.},

@article{citeulike:4871373,
	abstract = {Every cloud parameterization contains structural model errors. The source of these errors is difficult to pinpoint because cloud parameterizations contain nonlinearities and feedbacks. To elucidate these model inadequacies, this paper uses a general-purpose ensemble parameter estimation technique. In principle, the technique is applicable to any parameterization that contains a number of adjustable coefficients. It optimizes or calibrates parameter values by attempting to match predicted fields to reference datasets. Rather than striving to find the single best set of parameter values, the output is instead an ensemble of parameter sets. This ensemble provides a wealth of information. In particular, it can help uncover model deficiencies and structural errors that might not otherwise be easily revealed. The calibration technique is applied to an existing single-column model (SCM) that parameterizes boundary layer clouds. The SCM is a higher-order turbulence closure model. It is closed using a multivariate probability density function (PDF) that represents subgrid-scale variability. Reference datasets are provided by large-eddy simulations (LES) of a variety of cloudy boundary layers. The calibration technique locates some model errors in the SCM. As a result, empirical modifications are suggested. These modifications are evaluated with independent datasets and found to lead to an overall improvement in the SCM\&\#8217;s performance.},

@article{citeulike:395743,
	abstract = {Abstract--The mechanism(s) underlying ventricular fibrillation (VF) remain unclear. We hypothesized that at least some forms of VF are not random and that high-frequency periodic sources of activity manifest themselves as spatiotemporal periodicities, which drive VF. Twenty-four VF episodes from 8 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were studied using high-resolution video imaging in conjunction with ECG recordings and spectral analysis. Sequential wavefronts that activated the ventricles in a spatially and temporally periodic fashion were identified. In addition, we analyzed the lifespan and dynamics of wavelets in VF, using a new method of phase mapping that enables identification of phase singularity points (PSs), which flank individual wavelets. Spatiotemporal periodicity was found in 21 of 24 episodes. Complete reentry on the epicardial surface was observed in 3 of 24 episodes. The cycle length of discrete regions of spatiotemporal periodicity correlated highly with the dominant frequency of the optical pseudo-ECG (R2=0.75) and with the global bipolar electrogram (R2=0.79). The lifespan of PSs was short (14.7{+/-}14.4 ms); 98\% of PSs existed for <1 rotation. The mean number of waves entering (6.50{+/-}0.69) exceeded the mean number of waves that exited our mapping field (4.25{+/-}0.56; P<0.05). These results strongly suggest that ongoing stable sources are responsible for the majority of the frequency content of VF and therefore play a role in its maintenance. In this model, multiple wavelets resulting from wavebreaks do not appear to be responsible for the sustenance of this arrhythmia, but are rather the consequence of breakup of high-frequency activation from a dominant reentrant source.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of a strong mid-crustal reflector in the Rio Grande rift southwest of Socorro, New Mexico, were studied using high-quality digital seismograms of microearthquakes. The data are from a tight cluster of hypocenters located almost directly beneath the recording station (\~{}2 km). Cross-correlation of the direct and reflected microearthquake S phases yields coefficients which are positive and large in absolute value (average = 0.79). Because these two phases leave the focal region 180 deg out of phase for this swarm, reflection must occur at a discontinuity where a 180 deg phase shift occurs. Waveforms for the P-wave reflections are not identical from event to event within the swarm. The character of the P reflection indicates a magma body with rapid lateral changes in internal structure. The spectral characteristics of the reflected P phase are suggestive of constructive interference. The near-normal incidence geometry of both the reflected and direct P phase implies an essentially common path through the upper crust and near surface Phanerozoic rocks for these two phases. The earthquakes examined in this study are quite small (ML < 0); hence, the initial portion of the direct P phase may be used as the response function for the path through the upper crust during modeling of the reflected P phase. Synthetic seismograms, which include attenuation effects and interbed multiples, were calculated and compared to the observed waveforms. The results of modeling the stacked spectra of the PzP phase indicate a thin (70 m) layer of nonrigid, low-velocity material underlain by a second, thin (60 m) layer of slightly higher velocity material. This second layer may be an earlier, partially solidified intrusion or a crystalline mush at the base of a single magma chamber. The total thickness of the magma body is estimated to be < 150 m.},

	abstract = {Background Ventricular tachycardia may result from vortexlike reentrant excitation of the myocardium. Our general hypothesis is that in the structurally normal heart, these arrhythmias are the result of one or two nonstationary three-dimensional electrical scroll waves activating the heart muscle at very high frequencies.  Methods and Results We used a combination of high-resolution video imaging, electrocardiography, and image processing in the isolated rabbit heart, together with mathematical modeling. We characterized the dynamics of changes in transmembrane potential patterns on the epicardial surface of the ventricles using optical mapping. Image processing techniques were used to identify the surface manifestation of the reentrant organizing centers, and the location of these centers was used to determine the movement of the reentrant pathway. We also used numerical simulations incorporating Fitzhugh-Nagumo kinetics and realistic heart geometry to study how stationary and nonstationary scroll waves are manifest on the epicardial surface and in the simulated ECG. We present epicardial surface manifestations (reentrant spiral waves) and ECG patterns of nonstationary reentrant activity that are consistent with those generated by scroll waves established at the right and left ventricles. We identified the organizing centers of the reentrant circuits on the epicardial surface during polymorphic tachycardia, and these centers moved during the episodes. In addition, the arrhythmias that showed the greatest movement of the reentrant centers displayed the largest changes in QRS morphology. The numerical simulations showed that stationary scroll waves give rise to monomorphic ECG signals, but nonstationary meandering scroll waves give rise to undulating ECGs characteristic of torsade de pointes.  Conclusions Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the healthy, isolated rabbit heart is the result of either a single or paired ("figure-of-eight") nonstationary scroll waves. The extent of the scroll wave movement corresponds to the degree of polymorphism in the ECG. These results are consistent with our numerical simulations that showed monomorphic ECG patterns of activity for stationary scroll waves but polymorphic patterns for scroll waves that were nonstationary.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Microarray expression data reveal functionally associated proteins. However, most proteins that are associated are not actually in direct physical contact. Predicting physical interactions directly from microarrays is both a challenging and important task that we addressed by developing a novel machine learning method optimized for this task.  Results: We validated our SVM-based method on several independent datasets. At the same levels of accuracy, our method recovered more experimentally observed physical interactions than a conventional correlation based approach. Pairs predicted by our method to very likely interact were close in the overall network of interaction, suggesting our method as an aid for functional annotation. We applied the method to predict interactions in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A Gene Ontology function annotation analysis and literature search revealed several probable and novel predictions worthy of future experimental validation. We therefore hope our new method will improve the annotation of interactions as one component of multi-source integrated systems.  Contact: ts2186@columbia.edu 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn498},

	abstract = {To evaluate the usefulness of the atomic force microscope (AFM) for structural analysis of biomedical samples and to determine suitable sample preparation methods for AFM observation, the membrane of human erythrocytes prepared by various methods for electron microscopy was examined by the AFM. Strand-like elevations with 20-50 nm in width, 30-80 nm in length and 3-5 nm in height were observed, which formed networks composed of squares, pentagons and hexagons on the cytoplasmic or back surface of the erythrocyte membrane. Using colloidal gold labelled antibody, this network was found to contain spectrin molecules. Therefore it was very likely that the undercoat molecules of the plasma membrane were imaged by AFM. A large number of gentle elevations 300-400 nm in diameter and 2 nm in height were found to be distributed uniformly on the extracellular or true surface of intact erythrocyte, presumably reflecting the presence of undercoat membrane skeleton on the cytoplasmic surface. However, no structure that seemed to be derived from glycocalyces was discernible on the true surface. Structure corresponding to the unit membrane or lipid bilayer structure observable by electron microscopy was not demonstrated in the cross-section of the membrane. In freeze-fractured samples, a large number of small particles that corresponded. to the intramembranous particle were also demonstrated on the membrane halves. Since AFM allows depiction of the fine structures of biological samples with very simple sample processing at a resolution comparable to or exceeding that of SEM, imaging technology using AFM can be applied to obtain biomedical information. However, several problems have to be solved in future development of the equipment.},

When previously proposed scheduling algorithms have been shown to perform well in providing fair shares of bandwidth among single-hop wireless flows, they do not consider multi-hop flows with an end-to-end perspective when maximizing spatial reuse of bandwidth.In this paper, we analyze the issue of increasing such spatialreuse of bandwidth from an end-to-end perspective of multihopflows. Through analysis and simulation results, we show thatour proposed algorithm is able to appropriately distribute resources among multi-hop flows, so that end-to-end throughput may be maximized in wireless ad hoc networks, while still maintaining basic fairness across the multi-hop flows.},

The major problem of the wild type LiP is that it can be inactivated by excess H(2)O(2) and high concentrations of aromatic compounds. We applied a directed evolution technique coupled with a rapid colorimetric screening method to obtain mutant genes with improved H(2)O(2) stability and polychlorinated phenol degradability, and they were successfully expressed as the secretive LiPs in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting variants showed approximately 1.6-fold improved 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation activity and stability against H(2)O(2) compared with the parent strain. The kinetic properties of the variants toward 2,4-DCP and H(2)O(2) were also increased compared with the wild type for all three mutants studied. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the greatest number of amino acid substitutions was located near the surface or Ca(2+) binding sites of the enzyme.},

@article{citeulike:4871285,
	abstract = {Two long-standing questions about glucansucrases (EC 2.4.1.5) are how they control oligosaccharide versus polysaccharide synthesis and how they direct their glycosidic linkage specificity. This information is required for the production of tailor-made saccharides. Mutagenesis promises to be an effective tool for enzyme engineering approaches for altering the regioselectivity and acceptor substrate specificity. Therefore, we chose the most conserved motif around the transition state stabilizer in glucansucrases for a random mutagenesis of the glucansucrase GTFR of Streptococcus oralis, yielding different variants with altered reaction specificity. Modifications at position S628 achieved by saturation mutagenesis guided the reaction toward the synthesis of short chain oligosaccharides with a drastically increased yield of isomaltose (47\%) or leucrose (64\%). Alternatively, GTFR variant R624G/V630I/D717A exhibited a drastic switch in regioselectivity from a dextran type with mainly alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages to a mutan type polymer with predominantly alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. Targeted modifications demonstrated that both mutations near the transition state stabilizer, R624G and V630I, are contributing to this alteration. It is thus shown that mutagenesis can guide the transglycosylation reaction of glucansucrase enzymes toward the synthesis of (a) various short chain oligosaccharides or (b) novel polymers with completely altered linkages, without compromising their high transglycosylation activity and efficiency.},

Violation of the first guideline can seriously reduce the power of a test. Sometimes this reduction is spectacular, since it is most serious when the null hypothesis is grossly in error. The second guideline is of some importance when the conclusion of a test is equivocal. It has no direct bearing on power, but improves the level accuracy of a test.},

In each of the two pairings (vancomycin with peptide and DD-peptidase with peptide), polypeptide backbones were antiparallel, and the antibiotic or enzyme enveloped the peptide substrate from opposite sides. Hydrogen-bonding groups on the substrate which are involved with the DD-peptidase were shown to be different from the ones reported from nuclear magnetic resonance studies to be involved with vancomycin. Because of steric hindrance, the binding of either molecule to the substrate prevents the binding of the other molecule. Binding to the substrate by a D-alanyl-D-alanine-recognizing protein in a manner similar to that used by the DD-peptidase could explain recent observations of vancomycin resistance, in which a new membrane-associated protein has been detected.},

Following from these quantitative genetic findings, numerous molecular genetic studies of association and linkage between ADHD and a variety of candidate genes have been conducted during the past 10 years. The majority of the candidate genes studied underlie various facets of the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, although the etiological role of candidate genes outside of neurotransmitter systems (e.g., involved in various aspects of brain and nervous system development) have also been examined. In this paper, we review recent findings from candidate gene studies of childhood ADHD and highlight those candidate genes for which associations are most replicable and which thus appear most promising. We conclude with a consideration of some of the emerging themes that will be important in future studies of the genetics of ADHD.},

Here, we demonstrate that Xcad-11 initiates filopodia and lamellipodia formation, which is essential for CNC to populate pharyngeal pouches. We identified the cytoplasmic tail of Xcad-11 as both necessary and sufficient for proper CNC migration as long as it was linked to the plasma membrane.

Making use of the prior density, the likelihood, and Bayes' Theorem it is possible to estimate posterior moments of both structural and reduced form parameters. The MC method allows a rather liberal choice of prior distributions. The number of elementary operations to be preformed need not be an explosive function of the number of parameters involved. The method overcomes some existing difficulties of applying Bayesian methods to medium size models. The method is applied to a small scale macro model. The prior information used stems from considerations regarding short and long run behavior of the model and form extraneous observations on empirical long term ratios of economic variables. Likelihood contours for several parameter combinations are plotted, and some marginal posterior densities are assessed by MC.},

Oncogenic ras-encoded proteins differ from their normal homologues by an amino acid substitution for Gly 12, Ala 59 or Gln 61. Recently, we and others have observed that normal p21, encoded by the Ha-ras gene, has a GTP hydrolytic activity that is reduced by the oncogenic substitutions Val 12 or Thr 59. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two ras-related genes, RASsc1 and RASsc2, the expression of either of which is sufficient for viability. RASsc1 and RASsc2 encode proteins of 309 (SC1) and 322 (SC2) residues which are 62\% homologous to mammalian p21 in their 172-amino acid N-terminal sequences. We report here that the N-terminal domain of SC1 binds GTP and GDP and has a GTP hydrolytic activity that is reduced in the variants SC1[Thr 66] and SC1[Leu 68] which are analogous to oncogenic Ha[Thr 59] and Ha[Leu 61], respectively.

To date, no studies have been conducted to determine the statistical relationships between ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) events, increased precipitation, and rodent irruptions. Here we show that: 1) there is a statistical association between ENSO events and increased precipitation in the semiarid region of northern Chile; 2) the occurrence of rodent outbreaks in that region is statistically related with the precipitation levels of the same year; 3) the multi-annual patterns of the total annual precipitation levels and population abundance of those rodents during the summer are positively associated. The putative chain of effects seems to start with unusually high rainfall brought by ENSO to semiarid environments, which thus respond with increased primary productivity (herbage and seeds), which then fuels the rodent outbreaks.},

is down to subject-knowledge, communication skills, taking a research-led
approach or being a technological whiz, this book identifies and examines
interpretations of teaching excellence and helps the reader to develop their

evidence.

Using as its central case study the practice of the UK's most "excellent"
university teachers, as awarded by the National Teaching Fellowship Scheme,
this book features insightful interviews with all the award winners who teach
across a variety of subject areas, and establishes the key skills and
strategies which lead to their public accolade. As similar schemes exist
around the world, particularly the USA, Canada, Australia and South Africa,
the book offers a comparative analysis of these schemes and helps the reader
to locate national policies and practices within the growing worldwide
"excellence movement" in higher education.

Lecturers in any higher education establishment who are passionate about
raising the standards of their teaching will find much in this book to inform
and enthuse them. This book will also make an exceptional companion for
students on postgraduate, diploma and masters courses.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs are short, single-stranded RNAs that arise from a transient precursor duplex. We have identified a novel activity in HeLa cell extracts that can unwind the let-7 microRNA duplex. Using partially purified material, we have shown that microRNA helicase activity requires ATP and has a native molecular mass of [\~{}]68 kDa. Affinity purification of the unwinding activity revealed co-purification of P68 RNA helicase. Importantly, recombinant P68 RNA helicase was sufficient to unwind the let-7 duplex. Moreover, like its native homolog, P68 RNA helicase did not unwind an analogous small interfering RNA duplex. We further showed that knockdown of P68 inhibited let-7 microRNA function. From our data, we conclude that P68 RNA helicase is an essential component of the let-7 microRNA pathway, and in conjunction with other factors, it may play a role in the loading of let-7 microRNA into the silencing complex. 10.1074/jbc.M705054200},

	abstract = {Models postulating 2 distinct processing modes have been proposed in several topic areas within social and cognitive psychology. We advance a new conceptual model of the 2 processing modes. The structural basis of the new model is the idea, supported by psychological and neuropsychological evidence, that humans possess 2 memory systems. One system slowly learns general regularities, whereas the other can quickly form representations of unique or novel events. Associative retrieval or pattern completion in the slow-learning system elicited by a salient cue constitutes the effortless processing mode. The second processing mode is more conscious and effortful; it involves the intentional retrieval of explicit, symbolically represented rulesfrom either memory system and their use to guide processing. After presenting our model, we review existing dual-process models in several areas, emphasizing their similar assumptions of a quick, effortless processing mode that rests on well-learned prior associations and a second, more effortful processing mode that involves rule-based inferences and is employed only when people have both cognitive capacity and motivation. New insights and implications of the model for several topic areas are outlined. 10.1207/S15327957PSPR0402\_01},

A fundamental characteristic of epigenetics is that the same genome can show alternative phenotypes, which are based in different epigenetic states. Some of the most studied complex epigenetic phenomena including transposon activity and silencing recently exemplified by piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), position effect variegation, X-chromosome inactivation, parental imprinting, and paramutation have direct or indirect participation of an RNA component. Conceivably, most of the non-coding RNAs with no described function yet, are players in epigenetic mechanisms that are still not completely understood. In that regard, RNAs were recently implicated in new mechanisms of genetic information transfer in yeast, plants and mice. In this review article, the hypothesis that non-coding RNAs might be the main component of complex organisms acquired during evolution will be explored. The question of how evolutionary theories have been challenged by these molecules in association with epigenetic mechanisms will also be discussed here.},

All patients were known to have an underlying primary malignancy and were referred for PET/CT to evaluate the underlying primary and metastatic tumor burden. Definitive lesion characterization was determined by evaluating all histologic adrenal specimens and all relevant prior and follow-up CT scans, including unenhanced, contrast-enhanced, and delayed contrast-enhanced washout studies. RESULTS: Of the 139 benign lesions, 109 were considered benign by CT densitometry measurements and 135 by qualitative PET data. Qualitative PET characterized 28 of 30 benign lesions that were considered indeterminate by unenhanced CT. All 26 malignant lesions were characterized by PET: All showed qualitative and quantitative signal intensity greater than the liver. By combining unenhanced and qualitative CT data with the retrospective PET data, the analysis yielded a sensitivity of 100\% for the detection of malignancy, a specificity of 99\%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93\%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100\%, and an accuracy of 99\% (Table 1). Conversely, for the detection of benignity, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 99\%, 100\%, 100\%, 93\%, and 99\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: PET/CT is a highly accurate method for differentiating benign from malignant adrenal masses particularly when using qualitative, rather than quantitative, PET data. The routine use of quantitative mean or maximal SUV or SUR data may be unnecessary. Occasional benign lesions do show mild to moderate increased FDG uptake compared with that of the liver and may mimic some malignant lesions. Without evidence that these lesions are benign by unenhanced CT densitometry or adrenal mass stability or growth from previous CT scans, we recommend that these lesions be characterized using contrast-enhanced washout tests and that if those tests are inconclusive, using percutaneous biopsy if early lesion characterization is mandatory.},

In this article, we propose a Web user's degree of Web 2.0-ness to be measured by the weighted average of the degrees of Web 2.0-ness of the Web sites that he or she has visited. A Web site's degree of Web 2.0-ness in turn is evaluated through a series of binary criteria as to whether the site accommodates popular Web 2.0 applications. Utilizing clickstream data from an online panel coupled with expert scoring for the empirical analysis, we find that a Web user's degree of Web 2.0-ness is positively associated with his or her behavioral volume (measured by the number of page views), behavioral speed (measured by the duration of each page view), and behavioral concentration (measured by the Gini coefficient of page views the user made across Web sites). Furthermore, Web users who are younger and male are found to have a higher degree of Web 2.0-ness.},

Mutant I209A demonstrated a 3.2-fold enhanced k(cat)/K(m) for 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcourmarin O-deethylation, largely due to a dramatic decrease in K(m) (0.72 microM vs. 18 microM). I209A also demonstrated enhanced selectivity for testosterone 16beta-hydroxylation over 16alpha-hydroxylation. In contrast, V183L showed a 4-fold increased k(cat) for 7-benzyloxyresorufin debenzylation and a 4.7-fold increased k(cat)/K(m) for testosterone 16alpha-hydroxylation. V183L also displayed a 1.7-fold higher k(cat)/K(m) than P450 2B11dH with the anti-cancer prodrugs cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, resulting from a approximately 4-fold decrease in K(m). Introduction of the V183L mutation into full-length P450 2B11 did not enhance the k(cat)/K(m). Overall, the re-engineered P450 2B11dH enzymes exhibited enhanced catalytic efficiency with several substrates including the anti-cancer prodrugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sex hormones in serum have been hypothesized to influence the risk of prostate cancer. We performed a collaborative analysis of the existing worldwide epidemiologic data to examine these associations in a uniform manner and to provide more precise estimates of risks. METHODS: Data on serum concentrations of sex hormones from 18 prospective studies that included 3886 men with incident prostate cancer and 6438 control subjects were pooled by the Endogenous Hormones and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group. Relative risks (RRs) of prostate cancer by fifths of serum hormone concentration were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression with stratification by study, age at recruitment, and year of recruitment. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: No associations were found between the risk of prostate cancer and serum concentrations of testosterone, calculated free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, androstanediol glucuronide, estradiol, or calculated free estradiol. The serum concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin was modestly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (RR in the highest vs lowest fifth = 0.86, 95\% confidence interval = 0.75 to 0.98; P(trend) = .01). There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity among studies, and adjustment for potential confounders made little difference to the risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In this collaborative analysis of the worldwide data on endogenous hormones and prostate cancer risk, serum concentrations of sex hormones were not associated with the risk of prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Objectives . The goal of this study was to compare the effect of different tilts and capacitances for biphasic shocks on atrial defibrillation efficacy and pain threshold. Background . Although biphasic shocks have been shown to be superior to monophasic shocks, the effect of tilt and capacitance on atrial defibrillation success and pain perception has not been studied in patients. Methods . Atrial defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing was performed using a right atrial appendage/coronary sinus lead configuration in 38 patients with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing an invasive electrophysiologic study. Biphasic waveforms with 40\%, 50\%, 65\%, 80\%, 30\%/50\% and 40\%/50\% were tested randomly in 22 patients (Group 1). In 16 patients (Group 2), a 65\% tilt waveform with 50- and 120-μF capacitance was tested. Before sedation, pain sensation was graded by 15 patients in Group 1 after delivery of a 0.5-J shock and by 10 patients in Group 2 after two 1.5-J shocks with 50- and 120-μF capacitance were delivered. Results . The DFT energy for the 50\% tilt waveform was significantly lower than the 65\%, 80\% and 30\%/50\% tilt waveforms. The 40\%/50\% tilt waveform provided slightly lower energy requirements than the 50\% tilt waveform. Nine patients (60\%) described the 0.5-J shock as very painful, and four (26.6\%) complained of slight pain. The 50-μF capacitor lowered energy requirements compared with the 120-μF capacitor. Six patients (60\%) perceived the 1.5-J 50-μF capacitor shock as more painful, whereas three (30\%) perceived both shocks as equally painful. Conclusions . Biphasic waveforms with 50\% tilt in both phases and a smaller tilt in the positive phase than that in the negative phase (40\%/50\%) provided a decrease in energy requirements at atrial DFT. In addition, stored energy was reduced by biphasic shocks with 50-μF capacitance compared with 120-μF capacitance. Despite the reduction in energy requirements, shocks <1 J continued to be perceived as painful in the majority of patients.},

@article{citeulike:531287,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Currently there is a strong need for methods that help to obtain an accurate description of protein interfaces in order to be able to understand the principles that govern molecular recognition and protein function. Many of the recent efforts to computationally identify and characterize protein networks extract protein interaction information at atomic resolution from the PDB. However, they pay none or little attention to small protein ligands and solvent. They are key components and mediators of protein interactions and fundamental for a complete description of protein interfaces. Interactome profiling requires the development of computational tools to extract and analyze protein-protein, protein-ligand and detailed solvent interaction information from the PDB in an automatic and comparative fashion. Adding this information to the existing one on protein-protein interactions will allow us to better understand protein interaction networks and protein function. RESULTS: SCOWLP (Structural Characterization Of Water, Ligands and Proteins) is a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-based relational database for detailed characterization and visualization of the PDB protein interfaces. The SCOWLP database includes proteins, peptidic-ligands and interface water molecules as descriptors of protein interfaces. It contains currently 74,907 protein interfaces and 2,093,976 residue-residue interactions formed by 60,664 structural units (protein domains and peptidic-ligands) and their interacting solvent. The SCOWLP web-server allows detailed structural analysis and comparisons of protein interfaces at atomic level by text query of PDB codes and/or by navigating a SCOP-based tree. It includes a visualization tool to interactively display the interfaces and label interacting residues and interface solvent by atomic physicochemical properties. SCOWLP is automatically updated with every SCOP release. CONCLUSIONS: SCOWLP enriches substantially the description of protein interfaces by adding detailed interface information of peptidic-ligands and solvent to the existing protein-protein interaction databases. SCOWLP may be of interest to many structural bioinformaticians. It provides a platform for automatic global mapping of protein interfaces at atomic level, representing a useful tool for classification of protein interfaces, protein binding comparative studies, reconstruction of protein complexes and understanding protein networks. The web-server with the database and its additional summary tables used for our analysis are available at http://www.scowlp.org.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation is safe and effective. In this randomized prospective study, we have tried to evaluate the influence of different waveforms on the perception of pain during internal cardioversion in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Methods: Internal cardioversion was performed with minimal or no sedation in 31 consecutive patients, R wave triggered, biphasic shocks of 6 ms/6 ms or 3 ms/3 ms duration (randomly selected) and approximately 65\% tilt were used starting with a 50-V test shock. The shock intensity was increased in 40-V steps up to a maximum voltage of 520 V. Shocks were applied via two custom-made catheters (Elecath, Rahway, NJ). In 16 patients (3 females, age 61 ± 11 years, left atrium diameter 58 ± 5 mm, duration of atrial fibrillation 4 ± 4 months), 6/6 waveforms were used, and in 15 patients (1 female, age 62 ± 5 years, left atrium diameter 59 ± 4 mm, duration of atrial fibrillation 5 ± 2 months), 3/3 waveforms were used. After cardioversion, each patient was asked to quantify their pain on a scale from 0201310 (0 = no pain, 10 = intolerable). Fourteen of the 15 patients in the 3/3 ms and 15 of the 16 patients in the 6/6 ms group were successfully cardioverted. Patients from the 6/6 waveform group were cardioverted with a lower mean voltage of 254/92 versus 355/127 V (P \&lt; 0.02), at lower pain score 1.8 ± 1.3 versus 4.2 ± 2.2 (P \&lt; 0.05) with equivalent energy (6.8 ± 2.8 versus 6.2 ± 1.5 J, n.s.) and required lower doses of midazolam of 2.2 ± 1.9 versus 4.0 ± 1.8 mg IV (P \&lt; 0.02). The waveform used in internal cardioversion seems to have a major impact on the patients' perception of pain. These results imply that energy determines the success of a shock, but voltage determines the pain perceived by the patient. The use of waveforms that deliver greater energy at lower peak voltages offers the possibility of internal cardioversion with less sedation and greater patient tolerance.},

	abstract = {Recently, in an effort to improve the performance of wireless networks, there has been increased interest in protocols that rely on interactions between different layers. However, such cross-layer design can run at cross purposes with sound and longer-term architectural principles, and lead to various negative consequences. This motivates us to step back and reexamine holistically the issue of cross-layer design and its architectural ramifications. We contend that a good architectural design leads to proliferation and longevity, and illustrate this with some historical examples. Even though the wireless medium is fundamentally different from the wired one, and can offer undreamt of modalities of cooperation, we show that the conventional layered architecture is a reasonable way to operate wireless networks, and is in fact optimal up to an order. However the temptation and perhaps even the need to optimize by incorporating cross-layer adaptation cannot be ignored, so we examine the issues involved. We show that unintended cross-layer interactions can have undesirable consequences on overall system performance. We illustrate them by certain cross-layer schemes loosely based on recent proposals. We attempt to distill a few general principles for cross-layer design. Moreover, unbridled cross-layer design can lead to spaghetti design, which can stifle further innovation and be difficult to upkeep. At a critical time when wireless networks may be on the cusp of massive proliferation, the architectural considerations may be paramount. We argue that it behooves us to exercise caution while engaging in cross-layer design.},

Myopathy is a less common and poorly characterized additional neurological manifestation of gluten sensitivity. We present our experience with 13 patients who presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of a myopathy and in whom investigation led to the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity. Three of these patients had a neuropathy with or without ataxia in addition to the myopathy. The mean age at onset of the myopathic symptoms was 54 years. Ten patients had neurophysiological evidence of myopathy. Inflammatory myopathy was the most common finding on neuropathological examination. One patient had basophilic rimmed vacuoles suggestive of inclusion-body myositis. Six patients received immunosuppressive treatment in addition to starting on a gluten-free diet; five improved and one remained unchanged. Among seven patients not on immunosuppressive treatment, four showed clinical improvement of the myopathy with a gluten-free diet. The improvement was also associated with reduction or normalization of serum creatine kinase level. The myopathy progressed in one patient who refused the gluten-free diet. Myopathy may be another manifestation of gluten sensitivity and is likely to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. A gluten-free diet may be a useful therapeutic intervention.},

Here we show that insect networks also display characteristic traits of optimality. By using a graph representation of the chamber organization of termite nests and a disordered lattice model, it is found that these spatial nests are close to a percolation threshold. This suggests that termites build efficient systems of galleries spanning most of the nest volume at low cost. The evolutionary consequences are outlined.},

	abstract = {A critique is presented of the frequently used BruceWilding (BW) mixed-field scaling method for estimating the critical points of nonsymmetric model fluids from grand canonical simulation data. An explicit, systematic technique for implementing this method is set out, thereby revealing clearly a fortunate, close cancelation of contributions from the leading correction-to-scaling and thermal scaling functions that makes the method effective for Ising-type systems but that lacks a general theoretical basis. The BW approach does not allow for pressure mixing in the scaling fields, which is essential for representing a YangYang anomaly (namely, the divergence at criticality of the second temperature derivative, (d2musigma/dT 2), of the chemical potential musigma(T) on the phase boundary), but such behavior must be expected in realistic models. We show that allowance for pressure mixing does not alter the leading dependence of the critical temperature estimator, Tc(L), on the linear size, L, of the simulation box: this converges as L-(1+theta)/nu when L (where nu 0.6 and theta 0.5 are the correlation length and leading correction critical exponents). On the other hand, the critical density estimator, rhoc(L), gains a leading variation L-2beta/nu that dominates the previously claimed L-(1-alpha)/nu term (where alpha 0.1 and beta 0.3 are the specific heat and coexistence curve exponents). Numerically, the BW method provides estimates of Tc consistent with those obtained from recently developed unbiased techniques that do not require prior knowledge of the universal order-parameter and energy distribution functions; however, BW estimates of the critical densities, rhoc, prove significantly less reliable.},

We report experimental results suggesting proneural gene  neurogenin3  ( ngn3 ) participating in this regulatory network. Retinal expression of chick  ngn3  was confined to early neurogenesis. Overexpression of  ngn3  in chick retina reduced cell proliferation and expanded the population of ganglion cells into the territory normally occupied by amacrine cells.

Early gene  ngn1  was induced, but  ash1 ,  ngn2 ,  ath3 , and  chx10 , whose expressions persist through later phases of neurogenesis, were down-regulated. Expression of  ath5  was up-regulated at the locale corresponding to young ganglion cells, but was down-regulated at the locale corresponding to progenitor cells. These results suggest that  ngn3  regulates retinal neurogenesis by inducing regulatory genes for early-born neurons and repressing those for later-born cells.},

@article{citeulike:1475967,
	abstract = {There have been few insights into the biochemical origins of natural product biosynthesis from primary metabolism. Of particular interest are terpene synthases, which often mediate the committed step in particular biosynthetic pathways so that alteration of their product outcome is a key step in the derivation of novel natural products. These enzymes also catalyze complex reactions of significant mechanistic interest. Following an evolutionary lead from two recently diverged, functionally distinct diterpene synthase orthologs from different subspecies of rice, we have identified a single residue that can switch product outcome. Specifically, the mutation of a conserved isoleucine to threonine that acts to convert not only the originally targeted isokaurene synthase into a specific pimaradiene synthase but also has a much broader effect, which includes conversion of the ent-kaurene synthases found in all higher plants for gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis to the production of pimaradiene. This surprisingly facile switch for diterpene synthase catalytic specificity indicates the ease with which primary (gibberellin) metabolism can be subverted to secondary biosynthesis and may underlie the widespread occurrence of pimaradiene-derived natural products. In addition, because this isoleucine is required for the mechanistically more complex cyclization to tetracyclic kaurene, whereas substitution with threonine "short-circuits" this mechanism to produce the "simpler" tricyclic pimaradiene, our results have some implications regarding the means by which terpene synthases specify product outcome. 10.1073/pnas.0611454104},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the sensitivity and specificity of CT/magnetic resonance imaging serial review compared to fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT scanning to optimize colorectal cancer follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using standardized proformas, three blinded radiologists reviewed serial CT and magnetic resonance imaging in suspected cases of colorectal cancer recurrence in patients undergoing fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT imaging. RESULTS: Fifty eligible patients were included in the review. On follow-up, 23 patients had positive and 27 patients had negative diagnoses for colorectal cancer recurrence. Serial imaging review reduced the number of equivocal studies from 20 to 4 and unexplained carcinoembryonic antigen elevations from 17 to 10. Using fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT, the number of equivocal studies reduced from 20 to 6 and unexplained carcinoembryonic antigen elevations reduced from 17 to 10. Fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT altered management in 8 percent of patients (4/50, 95 percent CI, 0-16 percent). No significant differences were found between accuracy, sensitivity and specificity upon comparison of serial imaging review and fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT in detecting recurrent disease. Extra information was demonstrated on 18 fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT compared to serial imaging review in 8 of 50 patients and one patient had a positive incidental finding. CONCLUSIONS: With suspected recurrence, we recommend undertaking serial imaging review with careful correlation of suspicious findings with previous studies. Fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT imaging was useful when findings remain equivocal after serial imaging review for colorectal cancer recurrence.},

@article{citeulike:4871039,
	abstract = {Terpene synthases are a mechanistically intriguing family of enzymes that catalyze complex, multistep reactions that are capable of generating hundreds of structurally diverse hydrocarbon and oxygenated scaffolds of biological and commercial importance. Interestingly, distantly related terpene synthases from fungi to plants all contain an invariant three-dimensional fold, and molecular comparisons of their active sites indicate that they are enriched with relatively inert amino acid residues that do not react directly with the reaction intermediates. Therefore, catalytic specificity appears to rely on the contour and dynamics of the active site created by the positioning of amino acid backbones and side chains on this catalytic surface and by supporting layers of residues surrounding the synthase active site cavity. Despite the high degree of structural relatedness among terpene synthases, previous studies suggest that no clear relationship between phylogenic organization and catalytic specificities is easily deciphered. We now report on the reciprocal interconversion of catalytic specificities between two distinct yet evolutionarily related terpene synthases based on the systematic identification and mutational replacement of variable residues within and surrounding the active site. Furthermore, we uncover previously undocumented biosynthetic activity during the interconversion, activity that could have been present in a common ancestor of these two highly related synthases. These results provide a simplified means for mapping structural features that are responsible for functional attributes and a strategy for identifying residues that differentiate divergent biosynthetic properties in phylogenetically related terpene synthases.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Although there is strong circumstantial evidence that androgens are implicated in the etiology of prostate cancer, epidemiologic investigations have failed to demonstrate consistently that one or more steroid hormones are implicated. In contrast, recent epidemiologic studies unequivocally link serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels with risk for prostate cancer.  METHODS: We have performed the first meta-analysis of all previously published studies on hormonal predictors of risk for prostate cancer.  RESULTS: A meta-analysis restricted to studies that performed mutual adjustment for all measured serum hormones, age, and body mass index indicated that men whose total testosterone is in the highest quartile are 2.34 times more likely to develop prostate cancer (95\% confidence interval, 1.30 to 4.20). In contrast, levels of dihydrotestosterone and estradiol do not seem to play a role of equal importance. The only study that provides multivariably adjusted sex hormone-binding globulin data indicates that this binding protein is inversely related to prostate cancer risk (odds ratio, 0.46; 95\% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.89). Finally, all three studies that examined the role of serum IGF-1 have consistently demonstrated a positive and significant association with prostate cancer risk that is similar in magnitude to that of testosterone.  CONCLUSION: Men with either serum testosterone or IGF-1 levels in upper quartile of the population distribution have an approximately two-fold higher risk for developing prostate cancer.},

Our presumption is that forcing observers to change from constant rate to randomly paced head motion will disrupt their ability to discriminate latency based on perceived image slip. This study indicates that the disruption in motion pattern causes a shift in latency detection criteria and a minor degradation in discrimination ability. It is likely therefore that observers make at least some use of image slip in discriminating VE latency.

Despite all the available structural, sequence and biophysical information about protein-protein complexes, the physico-chemical patterns, if any, that make a protein surface likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions, remain elusive. Here, we apply protein docking simulations and analysis of the interaction energy landscapes to identify protein-protein interaction sites. The new protocol for global docking based on multi-start global energy optimization of an all-atom model of the ligand, with detailed receptor potentials and atomic solvation parameters optimized in a training set of 24 complexes, explores the conformational space around the whole receptor without restrictions. The ensembles of the rigid-body docking solutions generated by the simulations were subsequently used to project the docking energy landscapes onto the protein surfaces. We found that highly populated low-energy regions consistently corresponded to actual binding sites. The procedure was validated on a test set of 21 known protein-protein complexes not used in the training set. As much as 81\% of the predicted high-propensity patch residues were located correctly in the native interfaces. This approach can guide the design of mutations on the surfaces of proteins, provide geometrical details of a possible interaction, and help to annotate protein surfaces in structural proteomics.},

@article{citeulike:4870995,
	abstract = {It was recently shown that perceiving the avidity of T cell activation can be translated into peripheral T cell regulation to control autoimmune disease. This regulation is achieved by CD8(+) T cells that recognize a common surrogate target structure, Qa-1/Hsp60sp, preferentially expressed by activated T cells of intermediate but not high avidity. A truncated self-reactive repertoire, devoid of high-avidity T cells, generated by thymic negative selection, allows selective down-regulation of intermediate-avidity T cells to accomplish self-nonself discrimination in the periphery. Identification of the common surrogate target structure expressed on intermediate-avidity T cells opens up a conceptual theme to understand the relationship between the specificity of peripheral immune regulation and self-nonself discrimination. Here, we investigated peptide vaccination induced cross-protection mediated by CD8(+) T cells in two autoimmune disease models, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). We show that Qa-1 restricted CD8(+) T cells cross-protect animals from either EAE or T1D without abrogating the immune response to foreign antigens. Cross-protection occurs because potentially pathogenic self-reactive T cells included in the pool of intermediate-avidity T cells are capable of preferentially expressing common surrogate target structures on their surface to render themselves subject to the down-regulation, independent of the specificity of the antigens that they are triggered by. Thus, like in the thymus, the immune system discriminates self from nonself, during adaptive immunity in the periphery, not by recognizing the structural differences between self and foreign antigens, but rather by perceiving the avidity of T cell activation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer in general practice in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional study took place in England and Wales, was population-based and covered 469 159 men aged 45-84 years. Pathology data on PSA tests requested between 19 November 1999 and 31 May 2002 by general practitioners (GPs) were provided by 28 pathology laboratories. The practices recorded reasons for the tests between 1 December 2001 and 31 May 2002. In all, 391 practices in which all GP partners participated were included in the analyses. RESULTS: The overall annual rate of testing in men with no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer was estimated to be 6\%, of which the annual rates of asymptomatic, symptomatic and re-testing were 2.0\%, 2.8\% and 1.2\%, respectively, after adjusting for missing values. The rate decreased with increasing social deprivation, and with increasing proportions of black and Asian populations. The overall rate of PSA testing increased significantly from 1999 to 2002. CONCLUSIONS: If the recommendations of the National Health Service Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme were applied, 14\% of asymptomatic tests and 23\% of symptomatic tests would have led to a referral. As the rate of PSA testing is increasing and there are uncertainties about the benefit of screening, the workload and costs in general practice and hospitals should be monitored.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a brief patient decision aid (pDA) on men's knowledge, attitudes and intention to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. To explore the important predictors of intention to be tested in men who received the brief pDA. METHODS: A brief pDA designed to facilitate informed decision-making for men considering PSA testing was developed for the NHS Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. Men aged 40-75 years selected from 11 General Practices in England and Wales were randomised to receive either a mailed copy of the brief pDA and a questionnaire (intervention group), or a questionnaire alone (control group). The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, perceived risk and intention to have a PSA test and, for the intervention group, their perceptions of the brief pDA. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety of the men who were eligible for the study returned completed questionnaires (response rate=54\%). Men who received the brief pDA had significantly higher knowledge scores (p<0.0001) and less positive attitudes (p<0.0001) regarding PSA testing than men in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in intention to be tested within the next 12 months. 87\% of men found the brief pDA was easy to read, 94\% considered it contained about the right amount of detail and 94\% felt the information was presented in a balanced way. Multivariate analysis identified perceived risk (p<0.0001), perceived benefits of PSA testing (p<0.0001), knowledge (p=0.004), attitude (p=0.007) and age (p=0.01) as the most important independent predictors of intention to be tested amongst men in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The brief pDA was shown to dramatically increase men's knowledge of the benefits and risks of the PSA test. Men who received the brief pDA were significantly less positive about the PSA test, although there was no difference between the two groups regarding their intention to be tested within the next year. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This brief pDA could serve as an acceptable and low cost adjunct to counselling by the General Practitioner (GP), and should promote informed decision making regarding the PSA test. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of the decision aid during the consultation.},

We used the same active-site targeted saturation mutagenesis libraries from which we previously identified mutants with improved activity towards glycolaldehyde, which is C2-hydroxylated like all natural TK substrates. Comparison of the new mutants to those obtained previously reveals distinctly different subsets of enzyme active-site mutations with either improved overall enzyme activity, or improved specificity towards either the C2-hydroxylated or non-natural aliphatic aldehyde substrate. While mutation of phylogenetically variant residues was found previously to yield improved enzyme activity on glycolaldehyde, we show here that these mutants in fact gave improved activity on both substrate types. In comparison, the new mutants were obtained at conserved residues which interact with the C2-hydroxyl group of natural substrates, and gave up to 5-fold improvement in specific activity and 64-fold improvement in specificity towards propionaldehyde relative to glycolaldehyde. This suggests that saturation mutagenesis can be more selectively guided for evolution towards either natural or non-natural substrates, using both structural and sequence information.},

Adding or changing sugars attached to such natural products can improve the parent compound's pharmacological properties, specificity at multiple levels, and/or even the molecular mechanism of action. Though some natural-product glycosyltransferases (GTs) are sufficiently promiscuous for use in altering these glycosylation patterns, the stringent specificity of others remains a limiting factor in natural-product diversification and highlights a need for general GT engineering and evolution platforms. Herein we report the use of a simple high-throughput screen based on a fluorescent surrogate acceptor substrate to expand the promiscuity of a natural-product GT via directed evolution. Cumulatively, this study presents variant GTs for the glycorandomization of a range of therapeutically important acceptors, including aminocoumarins, flavonoids and macrolides, and a potential template for engineering other natural-product GTs.},

	abstract = {The role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) in the diagnostic localization of infectious diseases has expanded rapidly in years. In general, sensitivity of FDG PET in depicting infections compares favorably to other diagnostic modalities . It is shown to be useful in patients with suspected osteomyelitis, especially in chronic low grade infections and in vertebral osteomyelitis. although the sensitivity of FDG PET in prosthetic joint infections is very high, reported specificity varies considerably. In experienced centers, FDG uptake localized along the interface between bone and prosthesis can be used to diagnose infection with acceptable specificity. Combined leukocyte scintigraphy and bone scanning, however, remains the standard scintigraphic method for diagnosis of infected joint prostheses. FDG PET has shown promising results in vascular graft infections, in the evaluation of metastatic infectious foci inpatients with blood stream infections and in neutropenic patients, but further studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn . In fever of unknown origin (FUO), FDG PET appears to be of great advantage as malignancy, inflammation and infection can be detected. Image fusion combining PET and computed tomography facilitates anatomical localization of increased FDG uptake and better guiding for further diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis. In conclusion, the body of evidence on utility of FDG PET in infectious diseases and FUO is growing and FDG PET may become one of the preferred diagnostic procedures for many of these diseases, especially when a definite diagnosis cannot easily be achieved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current UK policy recommends informed decision making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. The process by which men decide to be tested warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the important influences on men's decision to have a PSA test. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 20 men who had raised the issue of testing for prostate cancer with their GP and undergone the PSA test. RESULTS: Men wanted to be tested primarily because they believed in the benefits of early diagnosis. Triggers for consulting the GP were the personal experiences of friends with prostate cancer, a desire to be proactive about health, media reports, a family history or ongoing urinary symptoms. Before consulting the GP, men's awareness was largely based on personal accounts and media stories and did not include much familiarity with the potential limitations of testing. Many had decided they wanted to be tested by the time they consulted their GP and this decision remained largely unaffected by the consultation. Men varied in the value they placed on receiving information about the benefits and limitations of PSA testing from their GP. CONCLUSIONS: Men who consult their GP about testing are often already committed to having the test. When information about the benefits and limitations of PSA testing is provided, at that stage it may be too late for it to play a part in their decision. Making balanced information available to men in the community may be a more effective way to promote informed decision making and to facilitate more useful discussions with the GP.},

Both the limiting form and the correction are predicted to be functions that are characteristic of the Ising universality class and are independently known. The theory is tested with extensive Monte Carlo studies of the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid, within the grand canonical ensemble. The simulations and scaling framework together are shown to provide a powerful way of identifying the location of the liquid-gas critical point, while confirming and clarifying its essentially Ising character. The simulations also show a clearly identifiable signature of the field-mixing responsible for the failure of the law of rectilinear diameter.},

	abstract = {Abstract In patients with osteoporosis treated with antiresorptive agents, reduction in bone turnover explains much of the observed fracture risk reduction. Lower levels of bone turnover markers (BTMs) appear to be associated with a lower risk of fracture in bisphosphonate-treated patients. BTMs were measured in a subset of subjects in the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial. Annual infusions of zoledronic acid 5 mg significantly reduced bone turnover markers: median decrease of 50\% for beta-CTX, 30\% for bone ALP and 56\% for PINP. The mean level of BTMs decreased in treated patients but remained within the premenopausal range prior to the next injection. The percentage of zoledronic acid-treated patients with values below the premenopausal reference range at all time points was 1.7\%, 17.8\% and 19\% for bone ALP, CTX and PINP, respectively. The third injection of zoledronic acid resulted in 60\% reduction of beta-CTX within 9-11 days followed by a gradual increase, indicating the persistence of osteoclastic bone resorption. The association between changes in BTM and fracture incidence was assessed in 1132 patients who had PINP measurements at baseline and 1 year. There was no association between low PINP levels at 1 year and increased fracture incidence. In summary: 1) annual injections of zoledronic acid reduced BTM in the premenopausal range, with a significant response persisting after the third infusion; 2) low levels of PINP were not associated with increased fracture risk.},

	abstract = {It is known that the Green's function for nondissipative acoustic or elastic wave propagation can be extracted by correlating noise recorded at different receivers. This property is often related to the invariance for time reversal of the acoustic or elastic wave equations. The diffusion equation is not invariant for time reversal. It is shown in this work that the Green's function of the diffusion equation can also be retrieved by correlating solutions of the diffusion equation that are excited randomly and are recorded at different locations. This property can be used to retrieve the Green's function for diffusive systems from ambient fluctuations. Potential applications include the fluid pressure in porous media, electromagnetic fields in conducting media, the diffusive transport of contaminants, and the intensity of multiply scattered waves.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bladder calculi are the second most common urological complication in those with spinal cord injury (SCI). Detection and removal of bladder stones are important to prevent possible complications. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of bladder stone detection based on catheter encrustation in asymptomatic individuals with SCI. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Cystoscopy findings in persons with SCI who were noted to have catheter encrustation at the time of catheter removal for their scheduled cystoscopy were used in this prospective study. Indwelling catheters were examined for encrustation at the time of removal as they were being prepared for cystoscopy. Cystoscopy was performed, and the presence or absence of bladder stones was noted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of bladder stones detected with cystoscopy in those with precystoscopy catheter encrustation. RESULTS: Forty-nine individuals with indwelling catheters were evaluated. Overall, 17/49 (35\%) individuals in this study had bladder stones. Catheter encrustation was noted in 13 patients. Of these 13 patients, 11 also had bladder stones. In other words, a positive result for catheter encrustation had a positive result for bladder stones 85\% of the time. Thirty-six individuals had no catheter encrustation. Of these, 6 (16\%) were found to have bladder stones. CONCLUSIONS: Encrustation of a catheter is highly predictive of the presence of bladder stones. This suggests that cystoscopy should be scheduled in a person undergoing a catheter change if catheter encrustation is noted.},

@article{citeulike:4870955,
	abstract = {The NHS \& Community Care Act 1990 heralded a new era in community care in the UK. Needs-led assessment and case management were to form the cornerstone of high quality care. Practitioners were challenged to alter their attitudes and practice to accommodate the needs-led approach. Previously they had assessed need to ascertain eligibility for statutory services, now they were required to identify "need" per se. The pivotal role given to assessment meant the success, or otherwise, of the reforms lay in part on the ability of practitioners to make this transition. However, to make needs-led assessment a reality, practitioners would have both to overcome conceptual barriers--need being an unclear concept, with no clear framework existing to assess need--and also to deal successfully with the conflicting requirement to ration services. In order to investigate whether the shift to needs-led practice had been possible, the opinions of social and healthcare practitioners providing services for older people in North Wales were sought through semi-structured interviews in 1994-1995 and 1998-1999. Supports and constraints to practice were also explored. Practitioners indicated that whilst they welcomed the needs-led philosophy, putting it into practice was difficult, if not impossible. The main constraints were a lack of resources (financial, service provision and staffing) and the conceptual difficulty of separating "need" from the "need for a particular service". Ever-tightening budgets and service eligibility criteria over the period of the study indicate that a shift of focus from assessment of need to rationing has taken place.},

	abstract = {Cocaine is recognized as the most reinforcing of all drugs of abuse. There is no anticocaine medication available. The disastrous medical and social consequences of cocaine addiction have made the development of an anticocaine medication a high priority. It has been recognized that an ideal anticocaine medication is one that accelerates cocaine metabolism producing biologically inactive metabolites via a route similar to the primary cocaine-metabolizing pathway, i.e., cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by plasma enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). However, wild-type BChE has a low catalytic efficiency against the abused cocaine. Design of a high-activity enzyme mutant is extremely challenging, particularly when the chemical reaction process is rate-determining for the enzymatic reaction. Here we report the design and discovery of a high-activity mutant of human BChE by using a novel, systematic computational design approach based on transition-state simulations and activation energy calculations. The novel computational design approach has led to discovery of the most efficient cocaine hydrolase, i.e., a human BChE mutant with an ∼2000-fold improved catalytic efficiency, promising for therapeutic treatment of cocaine overdose and addiction as an exogenous enzyme in human. The encouraging discovery resulted from the computational design not only provides a promising anticocaine medication but also demonstrates that the novel, generally applicable computational design approach is promising for rational enzyme redesign and drug discovery.},

Wild-type Novamyl is currently used in the baking industry as an anti-staling agent in breads baked at neutral or near neutral pH. However, the enzyme is rapidly inactivated during the baking process of bread made with low pH recipes and Novamyl thus has very limited beneficial effect for this particular application. In an effort to improve the performance of Novamyl for low pH bread applications such as sourdough and rye, two error-prone PCR libraries were generated, expressed in  Bacillus subtilis  and screened for variants with improved thermal stability and activity under low pH conditions. Variants exhibiting improved performance were iteratively recombined using  DNA shuffling  to create two generations of libraries. Relative to wild-type Novamyl, a number of the resulting variants exhibited more than 10 °C increase in thermal stability at pH 4.5, one of which demonstrated substantial anti-staling properties in low pH breads.},

SIPA (Services int\'{e}gr\'{e}s pour les personnes \^{a}g\'{e}es fragiles) is an integrated service model based on community services, a multidisciplinary team, case management that retains clinical responsibility for all the health and social services required, and the capacity to mobilize resources as required and according to the care protocol. The SIPA demonstration project used an experimental design, with random allocation of the 1,230 participants from two areas of Montreal to an experimental and a control group. The costs of institutional services were \$4,270 less for those in the SIPA group compared to the control group; the costs of community care were \$3,394 more. The proportion of persons waiting in acute care hospitals for nursing home placement was twice as high in the control group as in the SIPA group. The costs of acute hospitalizations for persons in the SIPA group with ADL disabilities were at least \$4,000 lower than those for persons in the control group. In conclusion, the SIPA trial showed that it is possible to undertake ambitious and rigorous demonstration projects in Canada. These results were obtained without an increase in the overall costs of health and social services, without reducing the quality of care, and without increasing the burden on elderly persons and their relatives.},

	abstract = {Terpene synthases often catalyze complex reactions involving intricate series of carbocation intermediates. The resulting, generally cyclical, structures provide initial hydrocarbon frameworks that underlie the astonishing structural diversity of the enormous class of terpenoid natural products (>50,000 known), and these enzymes often mediate the committed step in their particular biosynthetic pathway. Accordingly, how terpene synthases specify product outcome has drawn a great deal of attention. In previous work, we have shown that mutational introduction of a hydroxyl group at specific positions within diterpene synthase active sites can "short circuit" complex cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions, resulting in the production of "simpler"' diterpenes. Here we demonstrate that the converse change, substitution of an Ile for Thr at the relevant position in a native pimaradiene synthase, leads to a dramatic increase in reaction complexity. Product outcome is shifted from the tricyclic pimaradiene to a rearranged tetracycle, aphidicol-15-ene. Thus, the nature of the residue at this position acts as a true switch for product outcome. In addition, the ability of aliphatic residue substitution to enable a more complex reaction emphasizes the importance of substrate conformation imposed by a largely inert active site. Furthermore, the profound plasticity of diterpene synthases exemplified by this single residue switch for product outcome is consistent with the screening/diversity-oriented hypothesis of natural products metabolism.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively compare contrast material-enhanced harmonic compound ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting nodular infiltration in the spleen of patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval and informed consent, 100 consecutive patients with Hodgkin lymphoma during pretreatment staging were prospectively investigated for possible spleen involvement by comparing harmonic compound US (integrated with intravenous infusion of microbubbles in 33 patients) with CT and FDG PET. Findings indicative of malignant nodules with the imaging procedures were regarded as lymphoma infiltration; in case of discrepancy, response to treatment was regarded as evidence of lymphoma. RESULTS: Malignant nodules were detected with CT in 13 patients, with FDG PET in 13 patients, and with contrast-enhanced harmonic compound US in 30 patients. Coincidental findings of malignancy with all three imaging techniques occurred in 13 patients; 17 patients had only US-detectable malignant nodules, which showed disappearance or relevant decrease after chemotherapy. Overall, the spleen had nodular infiltration in 30 patients (13 for imaging finding concordance; 17 for typical contrast-enhanced harmonic compound US findings and chemotherapy-related nodule size modifications). Thus, both CT and FDG PET provided false-negative results in 17 of 30 patients compared with contrast-enhanced harmonic compound US, the results of which translated into disease upstaging in 13 patients. CONCLUSION: Harmonic compound US with contrast enhancement for the characterization of possible nodules provides a higher sensitivity than does CT or FDG PET in the detection of splenic involvement by Hodgkin lymphoma.},

play their part as well. For any given problem, there are many reasonable, but
only a few very good solutions. The authors' goal is to help readers learn to
make those very good design decisions on their own. The book explores
challenges that software developers will face as they build their design, and
shows how design patterns can be used to solve design problems. Long awaited

	abstract = {Many commercial computer games allow a team of players to match their skills against another team, controlled by humans or by the computer. Most players prefer human opponents, since the artificial intelligence of a computer-controlled team is in general inferior. An adaptive mechanism for team-oriented artificial intelligence would allow computer-controlled opponents to adapt to human player behaviour, thereby providing a means of dealing with weaknesses in the game AI. Current commercial computer games lack challenging adaptive mechanisms. This paper proposes  ” TEAM”, a novel team-oriented adaptive mechanism which is inspired by evolutionary algorithms. The performance of TEAM is evaluated in an experiment involving an actual commercial computer game (the Capture The Flag team-based game mode of the popular commercial computer game Quake III). The experimental results indicate that TEAM succeeds in endowing computer-controlled opponents with successful adaptive performance. We therefore conclude that TEAM can be successfully applied to generate challenging adaptive opponent behaviour in team-oriented commercial computer games.},

	abstract = {Bone metastases occur in 20-40\% of patients with lung cancer. Recent studies demonstrate a direct antiproliferative effect of 3rd generation bisphosphonates (BPs) on lung tumors, which may influence the survival. Therefore, we examined the clinical impact of zoledronic acid (ZOL; Zometa(R)), a 3rd generation BP, with a focus on the survival, time to progression and pain effect in lung cancer patients with bone metastases. Lung cancer patients (n = 144, Stage IV) with evidence of metastasis bone scan were included. Eighty-seven of 144 experienced bone pain and received ZOL, 4 mg i.v. every 21 days (Group A), whereas the other 57 patients received no ZOL (Group B). All patients were treated with a combination chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC = 6. It was found that Group A had a statistically significant longer survival (p < 0.01) when compared to Group B. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between the number of cycles of therapy with ZOL and total patient survival (p < 0.01, Pearson correlation) and time to progression (p < 0.01). Pain effect of ZOL had no significant difference between the 2 groups of patients (p > 0.05). Urine N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) levels decreased in patients with NTx </= 29 nM BCE/mM creatinine at baseline after treatment with ZOL. The results of our study suggest that the addition of ZOL increases overall survival in lung cancer patients with bone metastases. The longer period of receiving ZOL, the better effect on survival and time to progression. (c) 2009 UICC.},

We have recently demonstrated that substitution of a specific Ile with Thr was sufficient to "short circuit" the complex cyclization reaction normally catalyzed by ent-kaurene synthases to instead produce ent-pimaradiene. Here we report that the complex cyclization/rearrangement reaction catalyzed by abietadiene synthase can be similarly cut short to produce pimaradienes by an analogous Ser for Ala change, albeit with a slight shift in active site location to accommodate the difference in substrate stereochemistry. This result has mechanistic implications for enzymatic catalysis of abietadiene cyclization, and terpene synthases more broadly. Furthermore, these defined single residue switches may be useful in engineering product outcome in diterpene synthases more generally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional electrical stimulation (FES), is a means of producing a contraction in a paralyzed or weak muscle to enable function through electrical excitation of the innervating nerve. OBJECTIVE: This two-group randomized trial assessed the effects of single channel common peroneal nerve stimulation on objective aspects of gait relative to exercise therapy for people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). METHODS: Forty-four people with a diagnosis of SPMS and unilateral dropped foot completed the trial. Twenty patients were randomly allocated to a group receiving FES and the remaining 24 to a group receiving a physiotherapy home exercise program for a period of 18 weeks. RESULTS: The exercise group showed a statistically significant increase in 10 m walking speed and distance walked in 3 min, relative to the FES group who showed no significant change in walking performance without stimulation. At each stage of the trial, the FES group performed to a significantly higher level with FES than without for the same outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Exercise may provide a greater training effect on walking speed and endurance than FES for people with SPMS. FES may provide an orthotic benefit when outcome is measured using the same parameters. More research is required to investigate the combined therapeutic effects of FES and exercise for this patient group.},

This biocatalyst was the result of three rounds of mutagenesis and screening performed on the enzyme meso-diaminopimelate D-dehydrogenase. The first round targeted the active site of the wild-type enzyme and produced mutants that were no longer strictly dependent on the native substrate. The second and third rounds produced mutants that had an increased substrate range including straight- and branched-aliphatic amino acids and aromatic amino acids. The very high selectivity toward the D-enantiomer (95 to >99\% ee) was shown to be preserved even after the addition of the five mutations found in the three rounds of mutagenesis and screening.

	abstract = {English version Introduction. Esophageal duplication (ED) cyst is unusual congenital disorder of the foregut, accounting for 10\% to 15\% of duplications of all foregut cysts. We report a case of esophageal duplication with acute clinical presentation, treated successfully with surgical resection. Case report. 46-year-old man with acute dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux of 2 weeks duration, showed submucosal bulging mass in the posterior wall of the middle third of oesophagus, fluid-filled cystic structure, dyshomogeneous, low-attenuation mass with smooth borders compatible with an hemorrhagic esophageal duplication cyst. With the suspect of acute presentation of a complicated esophageal cyst, the patient underwent surgery by right posterolateral thoracotomy. A gastrografin esophagogram was performed on third postoperative day and showed no leaks. Discussion. Up to 80\% of the esophageal duplication cysts are diagnosed in childhood and the majority of young patients develop symptoms, while symptomatic cyst into adult life is very rare (<7\%). Acute onset is generally due to complications, i.e. intracystic hemorrhage, perforation, and infection, especially of the cyst with esophageal communication. Complete surgical excision by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy is the therapy of choice even if the patient is asymptomatic because of the risk of complications such as aspiration and bleeding. Conclusions. The diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cysts is still evolving. The pathological diagnosis of oesophageal duplication requires the presence of the Ladd and Gross criteria. The infrequent acute onset doesn't modify the management and the surgical resection is the procedure of choice. The future of the treatment of esophageal cysts lies in the advancement of minimally invasive operative techniques. Versione italiana Introduzione. La cisti da duplicazione esofagea \`{e} una rara malformazione congenita del tratto intestinale superiore (10-15\% di tutte le duplicazioni intestinali). Riportiamo di seguito un caso di duplicazione esofagea con esordio clinico acuto in un adulto, trattata chirurgicamente con successo. Caso clinico. Un uomo di 46 anni, con disfagia acuta e reflusso gastroesofageo da 2 settimane, risultava affetto all'esofagastroduodenoscopia da una formazione della parete posteriore dell'esofago, a contenuto cistico, disomogenea, con quadro radiologico compatibile con una cisti da duplicazione esofagea a contenuto emorragico. Con il sospetto di una cisti esofagea complicata, il paziente \`{e} stato sottoposto a toracotomia posterolaterale destra al fine di enucleare per via smussa la cisti integra, mantenendo la tonaca muscolare. Un transito esofageo con mezzo iodato idrosolubile in III giornata postoperatoria non ha mostrato leakage. Discussione. Pi\`{u} dell'80\% delle cisti da duplicazione esofagea sono sintomatiche e diagnosticate nell'infanzia, mentre \`{e} raro (<7\%) l'esordio clinico in et\`{a} adulta. La presentazione acuta pu\`{o} essere dovuta ad emorragia intracistica, perforazione, infezione, specie nel caso di continuit\`{a} con il lume. La completa escissione chirurgica toracotomica o toracoscopica \`{e} il trattamento di scelta, anche se la cisti \`{e} asintomatica, per il rischio di polmoniti da aspirazione di contenuto gastrico e di emorragia. Conclusioni. La diagnosi e il trattamento delle duplicazoni esofagee sono in evoluzione. La ecografia endoscopica \`{e} il metodo di scelta per la diagnosi, da porre con certezza in accordo con i criteri di Ladd e Gross. La presentazione clinica acuta non modifica il management e la resezione chirurgica \`{e} il trattamento di scelta.

The aim of the present study was to determine gait parameters in elderly people with different cognitive profiles (controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and Alzheimer's disease [AD] patients) with the Locometrix((R)) three-axis accelerometer and establish whether or not this tool is more useful than conventional clinical tests (the timed "get up and go" test, the pull test and the single-leg balance test). Study subjects were all over 65, living at home and free of known gait impairments. A neuropsychological battery was applied to 14 control subjects, 14 MCI subjects and six AD patients. A motor evaluation (in single- and dual-task paradigms) was performed with three conventional clinical tests and the Locometrix((R)) (standardized gait). Our results showed that in a single-task paradigm, the Locometrix((R)) was more accurate than validated, conventional tests and generated a characteristic gait profile for each of the three cognitive profiles. In a dual-task paradigm, the gait of MCI subjects more closely resembled that of AD patients than that of control subjects. We conclude that the Locometrix((R)) is a high-performance tool for defining gait profiles, which correspond to given cognitive profiles. The use of a dual-task paradigm is a good way to screen for gait abnormalities in MCI.},

In this retrospective study, we investigated the factors associated with bladder stone formation. The study population consisted of 141 men and 24 women (median age: 59 years) who were admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation, from January 2005 to December 2006. We investigated urinary pH, bacterial species in urine and duration of indwelling urethral catheter in the acute stage after spinal cord injury. Thirty-one patients (16.3\%) were diagnosed with bladder stones and underwent transurethral lithotripsy. Compared with patients without bladder stones, the duration of the indwelling catheter was longer in patients who bladder stones, but there was no difference between the two groups regarding urinary pH and the bacterial species found in urine. None of the patients for whom the duration of the indwelling catheter was less than a month developed bladder stones. These results suggest that long duration of the indwelling urethral catheter is a risk factor for the development of bladder stones. This information should be taken into account to reduce the occurrence of bladder stones and patients' morbidity.},

Based on youths' reports on the Multidimensional Assessment of Sex and Aggression and the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory, results showed that juvenile sexual offenders in residential placement had the most negative sexual and aggressive attitudes. There were also other noted differences between the two groups of sexual offenders as well as between youths with histories of sexual offenses and juvenile offenders with no such histories. The implications of these findings for research, theory, treatment, and risk assessment are discussed. 10.1177/1079063208322424},

We describe here a successful first application of a novel approach, which requires no structural knowledge and is shown to significantly reduce the number of mutants that need to be screened. In the first phase of this study, around 7000 mutants were screened through standard directed evolution, yielding a 230-fold improvement in activity relative to the wild type. Using sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, an additional single mutant was then produced, with 500-fold improved activity. In the second phase, a novel statistical method for protein improvement was used; building on data from the first phase, only 11 targeted additional mutants were produced through site-directed mutagenesis, and the best among them achieved a >1500-fold improvement in activity over the wild type. Thus, the statistical model underlying the experiment was validated, and its predictions were shown to reduce laboratory labor and resources.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the clinical efficacy of botulinum toxin type A in treating elbow flexor spasticity in a unilateral stroke population. LOCATION: A spasticity clinic at a regional neurological rehabilitation centre. STUDY DESIGN: A convenience sample longitudinal study. Fourteen subjects with elbow flexor spasticity secondary to a stroke were recruited. Two repeated measures, one before and another four weeks after treatment, were taken to quantify clinical efficacy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Elbow flexor spasticity was simultaneously rated with the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and quantified by measuring the surface EMG from the flexors using a custom-built device. Strength at the elbow (isometric), grip strength and upper limb function (Action Research Arm test) were also assessed. TREATMENT: Injections of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) to the m.biceps brachii (mean dose 70 U), m.brachioradialis (mean dose 56.5 U) and m.flexor digitorum longus (mean dose 83.3 U). RESULTS: Following treatment, spasticity (as measured by flexor EMG activity) reduced but the MAS was unable to detect this improvement. In some subjects, isometric flexor strength at the elbow as well as grip strength increased. This was contrary to the expected weakening following treatment with botulinum toxin type A and suggests an optimization of motor control. CONCLUSION: Treatment with Botox reduces spasticity but does not necessarily cause a reduction in the force generating capabilities at the joint. The improvement in strength may have contributed to the improvements in upper limb function. The MAS is an inappropriate measure of spasticity.},

To produce an S.\&nbsp;islandicus mutant suitable for genetic analyses, we screened for colonies with a spontaneous pyrEF mutation. One mutant was obtained containing only 233\&nbsp;bp of the original pyrE sequence in the mutant allele and it was used as a host to delete the β-glycosidase (lacS) gene. Two unmarked gene deletion methods were employed, namely plasmid integration and segregation, and marker replacement and looping out, and unmarked lacS mutants were obtained by each method. A new alternative recombination mechanism, i.e., marker circularization and integration, was shown to operate in the latter method, which did not yield the designed deletion mutation. Subsequently, Sulfolobus–E.\&nbsp;coli plasmid shuttle vectors were constructed, which genetically complemented ΔpyrEFΔlacS mutation after transformation. Thus, a complete set of genetic tools was established for S.\&nbsp;islandicus with pyrEF and lacS as genetic markers.},

Modeling studies were undertaken to identify combinations of mutations that cooperate to decrease the formation of products other than lanosterol. A double mutant was constructed and characterized and was shown to cyclize oxidosqualene accurately to lanosterol (99\%).

	abstract = {Bacteria have developed mechanisms to escape the first line of host defense, which is constituted by the recruitment of phagocytes to the sites of bacterial invasion. We previously described the chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus, a protein that blocks the activation of neutrophils via the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and C5aR. We now describe a new protein from S. aureus that impaired the neutrophil responses to FPR-like1 (FPRL1) agonists. FPRL1 inhibitory protein (FLIPr) inhibited the calcium mobilization in neutrophils stimulated with MMK-1, WKYMVM, prion-protein fragment PrP(106-126), and amyloid beta(1-42). Stimulation with low concentrations of fMLP was partly inhibited. Directed migration was also completely prevented toward MMK-1 and partly toward fMLP. Fluorescence-labeled FLIPr efficiently bound to neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, and NK cells. HEK293 cells transfected with human C5aR, FPR, FPRL1, and FPRL2 clearly showed that FLIPr directly bound to FPRL1 and, at higher concentrations, also to FPR but not to C5aR and FPRL2. FLIPr can reveal unknown inflammatory ligands crucial during S. aureus infections. As a novel described FPRL1 antagonist, it might lead to the development of therapeutic agents in FPRL1-mediated inflammatory components of diseases such as systemic amyloidosis, Alzheimer's, and prion disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrosalpinges have adverse effects on IVF outcomes. Salpingectomy is effective in improving outcomes, but it is not always practical or safe. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of hydrosalpinges at oocyte collection is an option for those who develop hydrosalpinges during controlled ovarian stimulation; however, there is no randomized evidence to show whether this practice is effective. METHODS: Between October 1999 and June 2003, consenting women of age <or=39 years with an ultrasound diagnosis of hydrosalpinx were randomized before oocyte collection to transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpinx under antibiotics cover or no aspiration. Third-party randomization was performed using a computer algorithm, and allocation concealment was achieved with opaque sealed envelopes. Outcomes were biochemical and clinical pregnancies, implantation, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic infection rates. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Sixty-six women were recruited to the trial, 32 to the aspiration group and 34 to the no-aspiration group. Aspiration resulted in a greater biochemical pregnancy rate [14/32 (43.8\%) versus 7/34 (20.6\%), relative risk (RR) = 2.1 (1.02, 4.6), P = 0.04]. Clinical pregnancy rates for aspiration versus control groups were 31.3\% (10/32) and 17.6\% (6/34), respectively [RR = 1.8 (0.8, 4.3), P = 0.20]. There were no changes in implantation rate or spontaneous abortion risk with aspiration and no differences between the groups in infection or ectopic pregnancy rates. CONCLUSIONS: In women who are identified to have hydrosalpinges during controlled ovarian stimulation during IVF, aspiration of hydrosalpinges during oocyte collection may be effective in improving pregnancy rates (Trial Registration Number: NCT00566956).},

METHOD: We used the MEDLINE, PsycLit and EMBASE databases as well as hand-searching to find relevant publications. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of adult ADHD was 2.5\% (95\% CI 2.1-3.1). Gender and mean age, interacting with each other, were significantly related to prevalence of ADHD. Meta-regression analysis indicated that the proportion of participants with ADHD decreased with age when men and women were equally represented in the sample. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of ADHD in adults declines with age in the general population. We think, however, that the unclear validity of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for this condition can lead to reduced prevalence rates by underestimation of the prevalence of adult ADHD.},

side by side, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since, under the
above transition, the hadronic-phase vacuum (filled up with gluon and chiral
\$q\bar q\$-condensates) turns into the "empty" (perturbation) subhadronic-phase
one and, thus, the corresponding (very high) pressure falls down rather
abruptly, the formerly cold (degenerated) nuclear medium starts to implode into
the new vacuum. If the mass of a star is sufficiently large, then this
implosion produces an enormous heating, which stops only after quark-gluon
plasma of a temperature about 100 MeV (or even higher) is formed to withstand
the gravitational compression (whereas the highest temperatures of supernovae
bursts are, at least, one order lower). As a consequence, a "burning wall" must
be, most probably, erected on the way of further collapsing the matter towards
a black hole formation.},

	abstract = {This review gives an overview of those in vivo imaging studies on synaptic neurotransmission, which so far have been performed on patients with movement disorders and/or dementia. Thereby, the focus is on disease-related deficiencies within the functional entity of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic or opioid synapse. In vivo investigations have yielded highly consistent results on the dysfunction of synaptic constituents in the majority of diseases covered by this overview. Findings show presynaptic dysfunctions in idiopathic as well as early-onset Parkinson's disease with decreases in striatal dopamine synthesis (57 out of a total of of 59 reports on both types of Parkinson's disease), storage (9 out of 9 reports), release (2 out of 3 reports) and transporter binding (95 out of 95 reports). In contrast, the "Parkinson plus" syndromes multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy are characterized by both pre- and postsynaptic deficiencies with reductions in striatal dopamine synthesis (11 out of a total of 11 reports on both types of "Parkinson plus" syndromes), storage (4 of 4 reports), and transporter binding (27 out of 27 reports) as well as D(1) (2 out of 2 reports) and D(2) receptor binding (34 out of 36 reports). This does not hold for the "Parkinson plus" syndromes dementia with Lewy bodies and corticobasal degeneration. For these diseases, for the time being, firm evidence of alterations in D(1) and/or D(2) receptor binding is lacking. In patients with Huntington's disease, mainly postsynaptic dysfunctions with reductions of striatal D(1) (6 out of 6 reports) and D(2) receptor binding (15 out of 15 reports) were observed. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by both pre-and postsynatic deficiences of the cholinergic system with decreases of cortical acetylcholine storage (1 out of 2 reports) and both musarinic (7 out of 10 reports) and nicotinic cholinergic receptor binding (3 out of 6 reports). Moreover, reductions in cortical (1 out of 3 reports) and limbic 5-HT(1A) (3 out of 3 reports) and cortical (4 out of 4 reports) and limbic 5-HT(2A) receptor binding (1 out of 2 reports) were observed. Moreover, there is evidence for a cortical (4 out of 6 reports) and cingulate (3 out of 3 reports) increase of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding indicative of microglial activation. In the majority of investigations on patients with Alzheimer's disease, no alterations of presynaptic dopamine function were found, whereas all other forms of dementia including corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia and frontotemporal dementia were characterized by presynatic dopaminergic deficiencies with reductions in striatal dopamine synthesis (10 out of a total of 10 reports on these types of dementia), storage (4 out of 4 reports) and transporter binding (29 out of 29 reports). Taken together, in vivo imaging methods can be employed for the diagnosis of idiopathic and early-onset Parkinson's disease as well as "Parkinson plus" syndromes and Huntington's disease. Moreover, differentiation is feasible between, firstly, Parkinson's disease and the "Parkinson plus" syndromes multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, secondly, multiple system atrophy/progressive supranuclear palsy and the other "Parkinson plus" syndromes dementia with Lewy bodies and corticobasal degeneration, and, thirdly, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.},

@article{citeulike:4870521,
	abstract = {This review gives an overview of those in vivo imaging studies on synaptic neurotransmission, which so far have been performed on patients with mental and affective disorders. Thereby, the focus is on disease-related deficiencies within the functional entities of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic synapse. So far, in vivo investigations have yielded rather inconsistent results on the dysfunctions of specific synaptic constituents in the pathophysiology of the diseases covered by this overview. Among the more congruent results are the findings of increased synthesis (8 out of a total of 12 reports) and release of dopamine (4 out of 4 reports) in the striatum of schizophrenic patients, which supports the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Results on both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission are inconsistent in both major depressive disorder and bipolar illness, and fail to clearly agree with the dopamine and/or serotonin hypothesis of depression. The majority of in vivo findings suggest no alterations (25 out of a total of 50 reports on serotonin synthesis, transporter as well as receptor binding) rather than a deficiency (merely 13 out of these 50 reports) of cortical serotonergic neurotransmission in major depression, whereas a decrease of cortical serotonergic neurotransmission (3 out of a total on 5 reports) can be assumed in bipolar illness. In borderline personality disorder, an increased binding of serotonin transporter binding was observed (merely 1 report). Due to the limited evidence, this result only with due caution may be interpreted as an indication for increased availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Patients with Tourette syndrome exhibited increases of DAT binding in the neostriatum (5 out of 10 reports) increases of dopamine storage and dopamine release in the ventral striatum (1 report, each). Moreover, striatal D(2) receptor binding was found to be decreased in advanced stages of the disease. Results, tentatively, may be interpreted in terms of an increased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic system. There is limited evidence of decreased dopamine synthesis in both children and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (4 out of a total of 10 reports). These findings as well as the reduction of striatal dopamine release observed in adults (merely 1 report) are in line with the notion of mesocortical dopaminergic hypofunction in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Thereby, however, in children, results on dopamine synthesis indicate a deficieny in the ventral tegmentum rather than in the prefrontal cortex, whereas, with increasing age, the prefrontal cortex rather than the sites of origin of DAergic innvervation become predominantly affected (merely 1 report, each). In anxiety disorders, varying results have been obtained for both pre- and/or postsynaptic dopaminergic, serotonergic and GABAergic binding sites. Thereby, results on posttraumatic stress disorder are homogenous reporting a decrease of GABA A receptor binding in all investigated brain regions including striatum, thalamus, neocortex and limbic system (2 out of 2 reports, each). Moreover, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder displayed increases of dopamine transporter binding (2 out of 4 reports) and decreases of both D(1) (merely 1 report) and D(2) receptor binding (4 out of 5 reports), respectively. These findings, tentatively, may be interpreted in terms of an increased availability of synaptic dopamine in the neostriatum, which is compensated for both pre- and postsynaptically by increasing dopamine reuptake into the presynaptic terminal, and decreasing (inhibitory) signal transduction of efferent fibers. The observed reduction of GABA A receptor binding in frontocortical neurons (in 11 out of a total of 21 reports on anxiety disorders) is in line with this assumption. The inconsistency (and, partially, also incompleteness) of in vivo findings on mental and affective disorders constitutes a major result of this overview. Discrepancies indicate that the regulation state of synaptic constituents may not only vary between the subtypes of disorders but also between subject cohorts and, even, individual patients depending on variables such as the predominance of symptoms, medication status or onset and duration of disease. This, for the time being, limits the application of in vivo imaging methods for differential diagnosis of mental and affective disorders. In vivo imaging results on anxiety disorders, however, are of possible interest with regard to psychoanalysis, as they offer a neurochemical correlate for Freud's theories on the pathogenesis of anxiety- and compulsion-related disorders.},

Single sorted Lgr5+ stem cells can also initiate these crypt\&\#8211;villus organoids. Tracing experiments indicate that the Lgr5+ stem-cell hierarchy is maintained in organoids.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics was used to simulate the transition state for the first chemical reaction step (TS1) of cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and its mutants. The simulated results demonstrate that the overall hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of (-)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of BChE in the TS1 structure for (-)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G BChE should be significantly stronger than that in the TS1 structure for (-)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by the WT BChE and other simulated BChE mutants. Thus, the transition-state simulations predict that A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G mutant of BChE should have a significantly lower energy barrier for the reaction process and, therefore, a significantly higher catalytic efficiency for (-)-cocaine hydrolysis. The theoretical prediction has been confirmed by wet experimental tests showing an {approx}(456 {+/-} 41)-fold improved catalytic efficiency of A199S/S287G/A328W/Y332G BChE against (-)-cocaine. This is a unique study to design an enzyme mutant based on transitionstate simulation. The designed BChE mutant has the highest catalytic efficiency against cocaine of all of the reported BChE mutants, demonstrating that the unique design approach based on transition-state simulation is promising for rational enzyme redesign and drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Objective: To study the association between several personality traits and all-cause mortality.  Methods: We established a historical cohort of 7216 subjects who completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) for research at the Mayo Clinic from 1962 to 1965, and who resided within a 120-mile radius centered in Rochester, MN. A total of 7080 subjects (98.1\%) were followed over four decades either actively (via a direct or proxy telephone interview) or passively (via review of medical records or by obtaining their death certificates). We examined the association of pessimistic, anxious, and depressive personality traits (as measured using MMPI scales) with all-cause mortality.  Results: A total of 4634 subjects (65.5\%) died during follow-up. Pessimistic, anxious, and depressive personality traits were associated with increased all-cause mortality in both men and women. In addition, we observed a linear trend of increasing risk from the first to the fourth quartile for all three scales. Results were similar in additional analyses considering the personality scores as continuous variables, in analyses combining the three personality traits into a composite neuroticism score, and in several sets of sensitivity analyses. These associations remained significant even when personality was measured early in life (ages 20-39 years).  Conclusions: Our findings suggest that personality traits related to neuroticism are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality even when they are measured early in life. 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31819e67db},

@article{citeulike:4870709,
	abstract = {Expression of the type I transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 has recently been recognized as a signature for cancer stem cells. In this study, we demonstrate that CD44, once engaged, is internalized and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to various promoters, including that of cyclin D1, leading to cell fate change through transcriptional reprogramming. In regulating cyclin D1 expression, the internalized CD44 forms a complex with STAT3 and p300 (acetyltransferase), eliciting STAT3 acetylation at lysine 685 and dimer formation in a cytokine- and growth factor-independent manner. A bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was mapped to the cytoplasmic tail of CD44, which mediates its nuclear translocation. Expression of CD44(NLS) mutant sequesters STAT3 in cytosol. In the nucleus, the acetylated STAT3 dimer remains associated with CD44 and binds to the cyclin D1 promoter, leading to increased cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation. This study describes a novel function for CD44 in transcriptional modulation through nuclear translocation of the internalized CD44 and complex formation with transcription factors. 10.1083/jcb.200812060},

@article{citeulike:4870697,
	abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for the conversion of a virtual-bond polypeptide chain (connected C alpha atoms) to an all-atom backbone, based on determining the most extensive hydrogen-bond network between the peptide groups of the backbone, while maintaining all of the backbone atoms in energetically feasible conformations. Hydrogen bonding is represented by aligning the peptide-group dipoles. These peptide groups are not contiguous in the amino acid sequence. The first dipoles to be aligned are those that are both sufficiently close in space to be arranged in approximately linear arrays termed dipole paths. The criteria used in the construction of dipole paths are: to assure good alignment of the greatest possible number of dipoles that are close in space; to optimize the electrostatic interactions between the dipoles that belong to different paths close in space; and to avoid locally unfavorable amino acid residue conformations. The equations for dipole alignment are solved separately for each path, and then the remaining single dipoles are aligned optimally with the electrostatic field from the dipoles that belong to the dipole-path network. A least-squares minimizer is used to keep the geometry of the alpha-carbon trace of the resulting backbone close to that of the input virtual-bond chain. This procedure is sufficient to convert the virtual-bond chain to a real chain; in applications to real systems, however, the final structure is obtained by minimizing the total ECEPP/2 (empirical conformational energy program for peptides) energy of the system, starting from the geometry resulting from the solution of the alignment equations. When applied to model alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures, the algorithm, followed by the ECEPP/2 energy minimization, resulted in an energy and backbone geometry characteristic of these alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures. Application to the alpha-carbon trace of the backbone of the crystallographic 5PTI structure of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, followed by ECEPP/2 energy minimization with C alpha-distance constraints, led to a structure with almost as low energy and root mean square deviation as the ECEPP/2 geometry analog of 5PTI, the best agreement between the crystal and reconstructed backbone being observed for the residues involved in the dipole-path network.},

	abstract = {Through an individual-level analysis of R\&D professionals in technology-based firms, the current study examines the moderating effects of task characteristics on the relationships between source characteristics and information source use in terms of use frequency and source internality, in the context of new product development. The results show that task characteristics moderate the effects of source characteristics on information source use. Specifically, task uncertainty moderates the effect of source accessibility on use frequency for both internal and external sources. The positive relationship between source accessibility and use frequency of information sources is stronger when task uncertainty is low than when it is high. Furthermore, the results reveal that task characteristics moderate the effects of source characteristics on source internality. The present study provides strong evidence that the key to understanding how task characteristics affect information source use and reconciling the disagreements between the least effort principle and the quality-driven perspective is to examine the moderating effects of task characteristics on information seeking behaviour, and take into account the potential substitution effect between internal and external sources in information seeking. 10.1177/0165551509105196},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Technological advances in high-throughput techniques and efficient data acquisition methods have resulted in a massive amount of life science data. The data is stored in numerous databases that have been established over the last decades and are essential resources for scientists nowadays. However, the diversity of the databases and the underlying data models make it difficult to combine this information for solving complex problems in systems biology. Currently, researchers typically have to browse several, often highly focused, databases to obtain the required information. Hence, there is a pressing need for more efficient systems for integrating, analyzing, and interpreting these data. The standardization and virtual consolidation of the databases is a major challenge resulting in a unified access to a variety of data sources.RESULTS:We present the Biochemical Network Database (BNDB), a powerful relational database platform, allowing a complete semantic integration of an extensive collection of external databases. BNDB is built upon a comprehensive and extensible object model called BioCore, which is powerful enough to model most known biochemical processes and at the same time easily extensible to be adapted to new biological concepts. Besides a webinterface for the search and curation of the data, a Java-based viewer (BiNA) provides a powerful platform-independent visualization and navigation of the data. BiNA uses sophisticated graph layout algorithms for an interactive visualization and navigation of BNDB.CONCLUSIONS:BNDB allows a simple, unified access to a variety of external data sources. Its tight integration with the biochemical network library BN++ offers the possibility for import, integration, analysis, and visualization of the data. BNDB is freely accessible at http://www.bndb.org.},

However, the relative importance of this modification versus monoubiquitylation in endocytosis, Golgi to endosome traffic, and sorting into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway remains unclear. In this study, we show that K63-linked ubiquitylation of the Gap1 permease is essential for its entry into the MVB pathway. Carboxypeptidase S also requires modification with a K63-Ub chain for correct MVB sorting. In contrast, monoubiquitylation of a single target lysine of Gap1 is a sufficient signal for its internalization from the cell surface, and Golgi to endosome transport of the permease requires neither its ubiquitylation nor the Ub-binding GAT (Gga and Tom1) domain of Gga (Golgi localizing, gamma-ear containing, ARF binding) adapter proteins, the latter being crucial for subsequent MVB sorting of the permease.

	abstract = {We propose a high-resolution technique for estimating the source time function of a seismic event from only one record. This                        technique is based on the spectral factorization of the minimum phase wavelet from the most random part of a seismogram: its                        coda. As the coda non-stationarity is inconsistent with the classical spectral factorization theory, we develop a two-step                        algorithm: first, the diffuse coda field is whitened to remove the non-stationary attenuation effect; second, the minimum                        phase wavelet equivalent of the seismic source time function is estimated. Applied to the recordings of the Kursk's wreck,                        this method gives a source wavelet strikingly similar to the general shape of an underwater explosion, allowing us to infer                        its depth and yield. Based on the fundamental  ” random” character of diffusive waves, this approach opens up promising applications                        for new blind deconvolution methods.},

	abstract = {We report progress made in the last few years on the general problem of the mechanism of fault growth and the scaling laws
                     that result. Results are now conclusive that fault growth is a self-similar process in which fault displacement d scales linearly
                     with fault length L. Both this result and the overall nature of along-strike fault displacement profiles are consistent with the Dugdale-Barenblatt
                     elastic-plastic fracture mechanics model. In this model there is a region of inelastic deformation near the crack tip in which
                     there is a breakdown from the yield strength of the unfractured rock to the residual frictional strength of the fault over
                     a breakdown length S and displacement d0 . Limited data also indicate that S and d0  also scale linearly with L, which implies that fracture energy G increases linearly with L. The scaling parameters in these relationships depend on rock properties and are therefore not universal. In our prime field
                     locality, the Volcanic Tableland of eastern California, we have collected data over 2 orders of magnitude in scale range that
                     show that faults obey a power law size distribution in which the exponent C in the cumulative distribution is ∼1.3. If the fault is growing within the brittle field, the zone of inelastic deformation
                     consists of a brittle process zone which leaves a wake of fractured rock adjacent to the fault. Preliminary results of modeling
                     the process zone are consistent with observations now in hand both in predicting the preferred orientation of cracks in the
                     process zone wake and the rate of falloff of crack density as a function of distance from the fault. The preferred orientation
                     of these cracks may be used to infer the mode and direction of propagation of the fault tip past the point in question. According
                     to the model, the width of the process zone wake may be used to infer the length of the fault at the time its tip passed the
                     measurement point, but data have not yet been collected to verify this prediction. If the fault displacement has been accumulated
                     by repeated seismic slips, each of these will sweep the fault with a crack tip stress field of a smaller spatial extent than
                     that of the fault tip stress field, producing an inner, more intensely fractured, process zone wake. This may be the mechanism
                     that creates the cataclasite zone, rather than simple frictional wear, as has been previously supposed.

	abstract = {Claudins form a large family of tight junction proteins that have essential roles in the control of paracellular ion flux and the maintenance of cell polarity. Many studies have shown that several claudin family members are abnormally expressed in various cancers. In particular, CLDN4 (encoding claudin-4) is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. However, although CLDN4 overexpression is well established, the mechanisms responsible for this abnormal regulation remain unknown. In the present study, we delineate a small region of the CLDN4 promoter critical for its expression. This region contains two Sp1 sites, both of which are required for promoter activity. However, because of the ubiquitous expression of Sp1, these sites, although necessary, are not sufficient to explain the patterns of gene expression of CLDN4 in various ovarian tissues. We show that the CLDN4 promoter is further controlled by epigenetic modifications of the Sp1-containing critical promoter region. Cells that overexpress CLDN4 exhibit low DNA methylation and high histone H3 acetylation of the critical CLDN4 promoter region, and the reverse is observed in cells that do not express CLDN4. Moreover, the CLDN4-negative cells can be induced to express CLDN4 through treatment with demethylating and/or acetylating agents. Because CLDN4 is elevated in a large fraction of ovarian cancer, the mechanism leading to deregulation may represent a general pathway in ovarian tumorigenesis and may lead to novel strategies for therapy and an overall better understanding of the biology of this disease. 10.1074/jbc.M603767200},

@article{citeulike:247393,
	abstract = {Segment match modeling uses a data base of highly refined known protein X-ray structures to build an unknown target structure from its amino acid sequence and the atomic coordinates of a few of its atoms (generally only the C alpha atoms). The target structure is first broken into a set of short segments. The data base is then searched for matching segments, which are fitted onto the framework of the target structure. Three criteria are used for choosing a matching data base segment: amino acid sequence similarity, conformational similarity (atomic co-ordinates), and compatibility with the target structure (van der Waals' interactions). The new method works surprisingly well: for eight test proteins ranging in size from 46 to 323 residues, the all-atom root-mean-square deviation of the modeled structures is between 0.93 A and 1.73 A (the average is 1.26 A). Deviations of this magnitude are comparable with those found for protein co-ordinates before and after refinement against X-ray data or for co-ordinates of the same protein in different crystal packings. These results are insensitive to errors in the C alpha positions or to missing C alpha atoms: accurate models can be built with C alpha errors of up to 1 A or by using only half the C alpha atoms. The fit to the X-ray structures is improved significantly by building several independent models based on different random choices and then averaging co-ordinates; this novel concept has general implications for other modeling tasks. The segment match modeling method is fully automatic, yields a complete set of atomic co-ordinates without any human intervention and is efficient (14 s/residue on the Silicon Graphics 4D/25 Personal Iris workstation.},

	abstract = {Humans show a unique pattern of brain growth that differentiates us from all other primates. In this study, we use virtual endocasts to provide a detailed description of shape changes during human postnatal ontogeny with geometric morphometric methods. Using CT scans of 108 dried human crania ranging in age from newborns to adults and several hundred landmarks and semi-landmarks, we find that the endocranial ontogenetic trajectory is curvilinear with two bends, separating three distinct phases of shape change. We test to what extent endocranial shape change is driven by size increase and whether the curved ontogenetic trajectory can be explained by a simple model of modular development of the endocranial base and the endocranial vault. The hypothesis that endocranial shape change is driven exclusively by brain growth is not supported; we find changes in endocranial shape after adult size has been attained and that the transition from high rates to low rates of size increase does not correspond to one of the shape trajectory bends. The ontogenetic trajectory of the endocranial vault analyzed separately is nearly linear; the trajectory of the endocranial base, in contrast, is curved. The endocranial vault therefore acts as one developmental module during human postnatal ontogeny. Our data suggest that the cranial base comprises several submodules that follow their own temporally and/or spatially disjunct growth trajectories.},

@article{cowgill_09_ontogeny,
	abstract = {While a wide variety of studies have focused on population variation in adult cross-sectional properties, relatively little is known about population variation in postcranial robusticity in immature individuals. Furthermore, the age at which the population differences readily detected in adults manifest during growth is also unknown. This research addresses these gaps in our current understanding through the analysis of immature humeral and femoral long bone strength. Cross-sectional geometry was used to compare the developmental trajectories of diaphyseal strength in Late Pleistocene Neandertal and modern human subadults to a sample of immature humans from seven geographically diverse Holocene populations. Population differences in size-standardized cross-sectional properties appear to be systemic and develop very early in ontogeny in the Holocene sample. In many cases, these differences are present before one year of age. In general, the Late Pleistocene fossil samples fit within the range of recent human variation in long bone strength. Population differences detected here are likely related to a combination of factors including activity patterns, genetic propensities, and nutritional status. These results highlight the complex mosaic of processes that result in adult postcranial robusticity, and suggest that further exploration of the developmental interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on skeletal robusticity will likely enhance our understanding of adult postcranial morphology.

Such form of the reconstruction files is efficient and parsimonious, and allows extensive morphometric analysis as well as the implementation of biophysical models of electrophysiology. Here, we describe Neuron\_Morpho, a plugin for the popular Java application ImageJ that mediates the digital reconstruction of neurons from image stacks.

@article{citeulike:4681190,
	abstract = {Excitatory input onto many neurons in the brain occurs onto specialized projections called dendritic spines. Despite their potential importance in neuronal function, direct experimental evidence on electrical signaling in dendritic spines is lacking as their small size makes them inaccessible to standard electrophysiological techniques. Here, we investigate electrical signaling in dendritic spines using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in cortical pyramidal neurons during backpropagating action potentials and synaptic input. Backpropagating action potentials were found to fully invade dendritic spines without voltage loss. The voltage change in dendritic spines during synaptic input ranged from a few millivolts up to approximately 20 mV. During hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, the amplitude of the synaptic voltage in spines was increased, consistent with the expected change resulting from the increased driving force. This observation suggests that voltage-activated channels do not significantly boost the voltage response in dendritic spines during synaptic input. Finally, we used simulations of our experimental observations in morphologically realistic models to estimate spine neck resistance. These simulations indicated that spine neck resistance ranges up to approximately 500 Mohms.

Conditional statements that described causal relationships (if mean value of cause, then mean value of effect) were embedded in simple arguments whose entailments are governed by the rules of truth-functional logic (i.e., modus ponens, modus tollens, denying the antecedent, and affirming the consequent). The causal statements differed in terms of the number of alternative causes and disabling conditions that characterized the causal relationship. (A disabling condition is an event that prevents an effect from occurring even though a relevant cause is present). Subjects were required to judge whether or not each argument's conclusion could be accepted. Judgements were found to vary systematically with the number of alternative causes and disabling conditions. Conclusions of arguments based on conditionals with few alternative causes or disabling conditions were found to be more acceptable than conclusions based on those with many.},

	abstract = {The thermostability of the endo-beta-1,4-xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (xynA) was improved by directed evolution using error-prone PCR. Transformants expressing the variant xylanases were first selected on 0.4\% Remazol Brilliant Blue-xylan and then exposed to 80 degrees C. Whereas the wild type XynA lost 90\% activity after 10 min at 80 degrees C, five mutants displayed both higher stabilities and activities than XynA. Four mutants were subjected to further mutagenesis to improve the stability and activity of the xylanase. Subsequent screening revealed three mutants with enhanced thermostability. Mutant 2B7-10 retained 71\% of its activity after treatment at 80 degrees C for 60 min and had a half-life of 215 min at 70 degrees C, which is higher than that attained by XynA. Sequence analysis of second generation mutants revealed that mutations were not concentrated in any particular region of the protein and exhibited much variation. The best mutant obtained from this study was variant 2B7-10, which had a single substitution (Y58F) in beta-sheet A of the protein, which is the hydrophilic, solvent-accessible outer surface of the enzyme. Most of the mutants obtained in this study displayed a compromise between stability and activity, the only exception being mutant 2B7-10. This variant showed increased activity and thermostability.},

	abstract = {We report on the electronic and optical properties of boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) thin films grown on quartz substrates by CH4/H2 plasma chemical vapor deposition. Diamond thin films with a thickness below 350 nm and with boron concentration ranging from 1017 to 1021\&nbsp;\&nbsp;cm\&minus;3 have been investigated. UV Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy have been used to assess the quality and morphology of the diamond films. Hall-effect measurements confirmed the expected p-type conductivity. At room temperature, the conductivity varies from 1.5\&times;10\&minus;8\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&minus;1 cm\&minus;1 for a nonintentionally doped film up to 76\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&minus;1 cm\&minus;1 for a heavily B-doped film. Increasing the doping level results in a higher carrier concentration while the mobility decreases from 1.8 down to 0.2\&nbsp;\&nbsp;cm2 V\&minus;1 s\&minus;1. For NCD films with low boron concentration, the conductivity strongly depends on temperature. However, the conductivity and the carrier concentration are no longer temperature dependent for films with the highest boron doping and the NCD films exhibit metallic properties. Highly doped films show superconducting properties with critical temperatures up to 2 K. The critical boron concentration for the metal-insulator transition is in the range from 2\&times;1020 up to 3\&times;1020\&nbsp;\&nbsp;cm\&minus;3. We discuss different transport mechanisms to explain the influence of the grain boundaries and boron doping on the electronic properties of NCD films. Valence-band transport dominates at low boron concentration and high temperatures, whereas hopping between boron acceptors is the dominant transport mechanism for boron-doping concentration close to the Mott transition. Grain boundaries strongly reduce the mobility for low and very high doping levels. However, at intermediate doping levels where hopping transport is important, grain boundaries have a less pronounced effect on the mobility. The influence of boron and the effect of grain boundaries on the optoelectronic properties of the NCD films are examined using spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements and photothermal deflection spectroscopy. Major differences occur in the low energy range, between 0.5 and 1.0 eV, where both boron impurities and the sp2 carbon phase in the grain boundaries govern the optical absorption.},

	abstract = {Cognitive impairment in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases is accompanied by altered morphologies on multiple scales. Understanding of the role of these structural changes in producing functional deficits in brain aging and neuropsychiatric disorders requires accurate three-dimensional representations of neuronal morphology, and realistic biophysical modeling that can directly relate structural changes to altered neuronal firing patterns. To date however, tools capable of resolving, digitizing and analyzing neuronal morphology on both local and global scales, and with sufficient throughput and automation, have been lacking. The precision of existing image analysis-based morphometric tools is restricted at the finest scales, where resolution of fine dendritic features and spine geometry is limited by the skeletonization methods used, and by quantization errors arising from insufficient imaging resolution. We are developing techniques for imaging, reconstruction and analysis of neuronal morphology that capture both local and global structural variation. To minimize quantization error and evaluate more precisely the fine geometry of dendrites and spines, we introduce a new shape analysis technique, the Rayburst sampling algorithm that uses the original grayscale data rather than the segmented images for precise, continuous radius estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to represent non-circular branch cross-sections and anisotropic structures such as dendritic spine heads, with greater accuracy. We apply the Rayburst technique to 3D neuronal shape analysis at different scales. We reconstruct and digitize entire neurons from stacks of laser-scanning microscopy images, as well as globally complex structures such as multineuron networks and microvascular networks. We also introduce imaging techniques necessary to recover detailed information on three-dimensional mass distribution and surface roughness of amyloid beta plaques from human Alzheimer's disease patients and from the Tg2576 mouse that expresses the "Swedish" mutation of the amyloid precursor protein. By providing true three-dimensional morphometry of complex histologic structures on multiple scales, the tools described in this report will enable multiscale biophysical modeling studies capable of testing potential mechanisms by which altered dendritic structure, spine geometry and network branching patterns that occur in normal aging and in many brain disorders, determine deficits of functions such as working memory and cognition.},

                        This zonal connection worked well during most of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events occurring after 1970; positive/negative

	abstract = {The genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers. Within an animal group CNEs are the most conserved sequences but between groups they are normally diverged beyond recognition. Alternative CNEs are, however, associated with an overlapping set of genes that control development in all animals. Here, we discuss the evidence that CNEs are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The major animal groups arose >550 million years ago. We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the "re-wiring" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.},

	abstract = {For the average citizen and the public, "earthquake prediction" means "short-term prediction," a prediction of a specific earthquake on a relatively short time scale. Such prediction must specify the time, place, and magnitude of the earthquake in question with sufficiently high reliability. For this type of prediction, one must rely on some short-term precursors. Examinations of strain changes just before large earthquakes suggest that consistent detection of such precursory strain changes cannot be expected. Other precursory phenomena such as foreshocks and nonseismological anomalies do not occur consistently either. Thus, reliable short-term prediction would be very difficult. Although short-term predictions with large uncertainties could be useful for some areas if their social and economic environments can tolerate false alarms, such predictions would be impractical for most modern industrialized cities. A strategy for effective seismic hazard reduction is to take full advantage of the recent technical advancements in seismology, computers, and communication. In highly industrialized communities, rapid earthquake information is critically important for emergency services agencies, utilities, communications, financial companies, and media to make quick reports and damage estimates and to determine where emergency response is most needed. Long-term forecast, or prognosis, of earthquakes is important for development of realistic building codes, retrofitting existing structures, and land-use planning, but the distinction between short-term and long-term predictions needs to be clearly communicated to the public to avoid misunderstanding.},

For this mechanism, the internal friction (the reciprocal of the  ” intrinsic ” of the material) depends strongly upon frequency and is in good agreement with Walsh's theory of attenuation (, 74, 4333, 1969) in partially melted rock. When Walsh's theory is extended to provide a model of the anelasticity of the earth, using the experimental values of physical parameters reported here, the results are in excellent agreement with seismic observations.},

Using long-period seismic waveforms and an inversion approach that includes constraints from mineral physics, we find that lateral variations of temperature can explain a large part of the data in the upper mantle. The additional compositional signature of cratons emerges in the global model as well. Above 300 km, we obtain seismic geotherms that span the range of expected temperatures in various tectonic regions. Absolute velocities and gradients with depth are well constrained by the seismic data throughout the upper mantle, except near discontinuities. The seismic data are consistent with a slower transition zone and an overall faster shallow upper mantle, which is not compatible with a homogenous dry pyrolite composition. A gradual enrichment with depth in a garnet-rich component helps to reduce the observed discrepancies. A hydrated transition zone would help to lower the velocities in the transition zone, but it does not explain the seismic structure above it.},

We focus on the critical regime of the phase separation and look for signs of crossover from three-dimensional (3D) Ising to two-dimensional (2D) Ising universality. To extract the critical behavior, finite size scaling techniques are used, including the recently proposed algorithm of Kim et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 065701 (2003)]. Our results point to "effective" critical exponents that differ profoundly from 3D Ising values, and that are already very close to 2D Ising values. In particular, we observe that the critical exponent  of the order parameter in the confined system is smaller than in 3D bulk, yielding a "flatter" binodal. Our results also show an increase in the critical colloid packing fraction in the confined system with respect to the bulk. The latter seems consistent with theoretical expectations, although subtleties due to singularities in the critical behavior of the coexistence diameter cannot be ruled out.},

@article{citeulike:3368625,
	abstract = {The males of many butterfly species compete via pair-wise intrasexual contests, yet lack any obvious morphological traits conventionally associated with animal aggression. The evolution of contest behavior in this group is therefore interesting because the means by which individuals are able to inflict costs upon each other during combat are unclear. Here we review the relevant empirical information within a game-theoretical context in order to analyze contest-related costs and mechanisms of dispute settlement. Territorial butterfly contests carry obvious role asymmetries, and individuals in the 'resident' role are more likely to win across all studied species. We use this phenomenon as a framework for gaining further insight into the evolution of contest settlement in this group. Four principal hypotheses are evaluated: (1) that residency is used as an arbitrary convention, (2) that residents stand to gain a greater payoff if successful, (3) that residency bestows higher resource-holding potential (RHP) on males in that role, and (4) that residents are males of intrinsically higher RHP. We found most support for the latter explanation (the 'superior-competitor' hypothesis), partly because the alternatives require a restrictive set of ecological conditions, but also due to positive support for the idea of intrinsic RHP. The strongest evidence is provided by species in which repeated interactions (between the same individuals) always have the same outcome, regardless of changes in residency status. However, we also found a consistent effect on contest duration due to apparent 'confusion over residency,' which suggests a conventional element to contest behavior. Although butterfly contests must be costly in some way, the literature provides limited insight into how costs accrue, and hence the determinants of contest RHP remain obscure. We suggest that careful experimentation, using 'natural' manipulations where possible, should prove most beneficial in identifying costs and exploring schedules of contest settlement in this group. Moreover, future investigations should be sensitive to the fact that butterfly territoriality and associated male-male interactions are seated within a broader ecological and life-historical context.},

Our starting point is the observation that BAR can often compute the free energy difference between two states without the need for intermediate states usually employed (and necessary) in alchemical free energy simulations. This is demonstrated first for the free energy difference between ethane and methanol in aqueous solution. We then show how BAR can be used to compute directly rather unusual free energy differences, such as the free energy difference resulting from changing the treatment of electrostatic interactions, from switching the force field, or from using an implicit solvent model.

	abstract = {We have calculated the binding free energies of a series of benzamidine-like inhibitors to trypsin with a polarizable force field using both explicit and implicit solvent approaches. Free energy perturbation has been performed for the ligands in bulk water and in protein complex with molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated from explicit solvent simulations are well within the accuracy of experimental measurement and the direction of change is predicted correctly in all cases. We analyzed the molecular dipole moments of the ligands in gas, water and protein environments. Neither binding affinity nor ligand solvation free energy in bulk water shows much dependence on the molecular dipole moments of the ligands. Substitution of the aromatic or the charged group in the ligand results in considerable change in the solvation energy in bulk water and protein whereas the binding affinity varies insignificantly due to cancellation. The effect of chemical modification on ligand charge distribution is mostly local. Replacing benzene with diazine has minimal impact on the atomic multipoles at the amidinium group. We have also utilized an implicit solvent based end-state approach to evaluate the binding free energies of these inhibitors. In this approach, the polarizable multipole model combined with Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PMPB/SA) provides the electrostatic interaction energy and the polar solvation free energy. Overall the relative binding free energies obtained from the MM-PMPB/SA model are in good agreement with the experimental data. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2009},

The time average dipole strength and dipolarity of the magnetic field decrease, whereas the dipole variability, average dipole tilt angle, and frequency of polarity reversals increase with Rayleigh number. Chaotic gravitational dynamos have large-amplitude dipole secular variation with maximum power at frequencies corresponding to a few cycles per million years on Earth. Their external magnetic field structure, dipole statistics, low-frequency power spectra, and polarity reversal frequency are comparable to the geomagnetic field. The magnetic variability is driven by the Lorentz force and is characterized by an inverse correlation between dynamo magnetic and kinetic energy fluctuations. A constant energy dissipation theory accounts for this inverse energy correlation, which is shown to produce conditions favorable for dipole drift, polarity reversals, and excursions.},

	abstract = {Free energy calculations are fundamental to obtaining accurate theoretical estimates of many important biological phenomena including hydration energies, protein-ligand binding affinities and energetics of conformational changes. Unlike traditional free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, lambda-dynamics treats the conventional ldquolambdardquo as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations and simultaneously evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the theory of lambda-dynamics, including the use of biasing and restraining potentials to facilitate conformational sampling. We review how lambda-dynamics has been used to rapidly and reliably compute relative hydration free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands, to accurately identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon protein stability. Finally, we suggest how lambda-dynamics may be extended to facilitate modeling efforts in structure-based drug design. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2009},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. RESULTS: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1--20\% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.},

	abstract = {The conserved, membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 envelope glycoprotein 41 subunit is required for fusogenic activity. It has been proposed that MPER functions by disrupting the virion membrane. Supporting its critical role in viral entry as a membrane-bound entity, MPER constitutes the target for broadly neutralizing antibodies that have evolved mechanisms to recognize membrane-inserted epitopes. We have analyzed here the molecular mechanisms of membrane permeabilization induced by N-preTM and PreTM-C, two peptides derived from MPER sequences showing a tendency to associate with the bilayer interface or to transfer into the hydrocarbon core, respectively. Both peptides contained the full epitope sequence recognized by the 4E10 monoclonal antibody (MAb4E10), which was subsequently used to probe peptide accessibility from the water phase. Capacities of N-preTM and PreTM-C for associating with vesicles and inducing their permeabilization were comparable. However, MAb4E10 specifically blocked the permeabilization induced by N-preTM but did not appreciably affect that induced by PreTM-C. Supporting the existence of different membrane-bound lytic structures, N-preTM was running as a monomer on SDS−PAGE and induced the graded release of vesicular contents, whereas PreTM-C migrated on SDS−PAGE as dimers and permeabilized vesicles following an all-or-none mechanism, reminiscent of that underlying melittin-induced membrane lysis. These results support the functional segmentation of gp41 membrane regions into hydrophobic subdomains, which might expose neutralizing epitopes and induce membrane-disrupting effects following distinct patterns during the fusion cascade.},

	abstract = {Recent reports linking insertional activation of LMO2 following gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) have led to a re-evaluation of risks following gene therapy with retroviral vectors. In our analysis of 702 integration sites in rhesus macaques that underwent transplantation up to 7 years earlier with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived retroviral vectors containing marker genes, we detected insertion into one locus, the Mds1/Evi1 region, a total of 14 times in 9 animals. Mds1/Evi1 integrations were observed stably long term, primarily in myeloid cells. We hypothesize that this over-representation likely results from an impact on the self-renewal and engraftment potential of CD34+ progenitor cells via insertional mutagenesis at this specific locus. There is no evidence of ongoing in vivo clonal expansion of the Mds1/Evi1 populations, and all animals are hematologically normal without evidence for leukemia. Characterization of integration sites in this relevant preclinical model provides critical information for gene therapy risk assessment as well as identification of genes controlling hematopoiesis.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression profile analyses have been used in numerous studies covering a broad range of areas in biology. When unreliable measurements are excluded, missing values are introduced in gene expression profiles. Although existing multivariate analysis methods have difficulty with the treatment of missing values, this problem has received little attention. There are many options for dealing with missing values, each of which reaches drastically different results. Ignoring missing values is the simplest method and is frequently applied. This approach, however, has its flaws. In this article, we propose an estimation method for missing values, which is based on Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA). Although the methodology that a probabilistic model and latent variables are estimated simultaneously within the framework of Bayes inference is not new in principle, actual BPCA implementation that makes it possible to estimate arbitrary missing variables is new in terms of statistical methodology. RESULTS: When applied to DNA microarray data from various experimental conditions, the BPCA method exhibited markedly better estimation ability than other recently proposed methods, such as singular value decomposition and K-nearest neighbors. While the estimation performance of existing methods depends on model parameters whose determination is difficult, our BPCA method is free from this difficulty. Accordingly, the BPCA method provides accurate and convenient estimation for missing values. AVAILABILITY: The software is available at http://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/\~{}shige-o/tools/.},

The annotation of these key regulators of transcription is lagging far behind the annotation of the transcriptome itself. Here, we give an overview of existing computational methods to detect these CRMs in metazoan genomes. We subdivide these methods into three classes: CRM scanners screen sequences for CRMs based on predefined models that often consist of multiple position weight matrices (PWMs). CRM builders construct models of similar CRMs controlling a set of co-regulated or co-expressed genes. CRM genome screeners screen sequences or complete genomes for CRMs as homotypic or heterotypic clusters of binding sites for any combination of transcription factors. We believe that CRM scanners are currently the most advanced methods, although their applicability is limited. Finally, we argue that CRM builders that make use of PWM libraries will benefit greatly from future advances and will prove to be most instrumental for the annotation of regulatory regions in metazoan genomes. 10.1093/bib/bbp025},

For this study, small cylindrical samples (∅ 1 and 3\&nbsp;mm) were examined with different experimental setups resulting in a nominal voxel size of approximately 1.48\&nbsp;×\&nbsp;1.48\&nbsp;×\&nbsp;1.48 and 3.7\&nbsp;×\&nbsp;3.7\&nbsp;×\&nbsp;3.7\&nbsp;μm3, respectively. Suitability of the TOMCAT microscope for 3D investigations of wood anatomy was tested on several softwood and hardwood species revealing microscopic features (e.g. tyloses, wall thickenings or pits) down to the nominal pixel size. The results suggest that even features in the sub-voxel range can be made visible. Tomographic microscopy was also tested for wood technological applications, i.e. penetration behaviour of a wood preservative and also of three wood adhesives (poly-urethane resins) with different viscosities. Although the experiments with the preservative yielded no clear results, the method seems suitable for examining the penetration of the different adhesives. The adhesive penetrates the wood mainly by the vessels where it can be easily discerned from the wood structure.},

	abstract = {Quality of microarray gene expression data has emerged as a new research topic. As in other areas, microarray quality is assessed by comparing suitable numerical summaries across microarrays, so that outliers and trends can be visualized and poor-quality arrays or variable-quality sets of arrays can be identified. Because each single array comprises tens or hundreds of thousands of measurements, the challenge is to find numerical summaries that can be used to make accurate quality calls. Toward this end, several new quality measures are introduced based on probe-level and probeset-level information, all obtained as a byproduct of the low-level analysis algorithms RMA/fitPLM for Affymetrix GeneChips. Quality landscapes spatially localize chip or hybridization problems. Numerical chip quality measures are derived from the distributions of normalized unscaled standard errors and relative log expressions. Quality of chip batches is assessed by residual scale factors. These quality assessment measures are demonstrated on a variety of data sets, including spike-in experiments, small lab experiments, and multisite studies. They are compared with Affymetrix's individual chip quality report.},

	abstract = {<p>Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations—e.g., random noise—cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being  ” suboptimal”. Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the  ” neural code”. Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise—via stochastic resonance or otherwise—than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing  ” noise benefits”, and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.</p>},

kinematical endpoints for sparticle mass determination. We consider the typical
decay chain in supersymmetry (SUSY) squark -\&gt; neutralino -\&gt; slepton -\&gt; LSP,
which yields a jet j and two leptons ln and lf. The conventional approaches use
the upper kinematical endpoints of the individual distributions m\_{jll},
m\_{jl(lo)} and m\_{jl(hi)}, all three of which suffer from parameter space
region ambiguities and may lead to multiple solutions for the SUSY mass
spectrum. In contrast, we do not use m\_{jll}, m\_{jl(lo)} and m\_{jl(hi)}, and
instead propose a new set of (infinitely many) variables whose upper kinematic
endpoints exhibit reduced sensitivity to the parameter space region. We then
outline an alternative, much simplified procedure for obtaining the SUSY mass
spectrum. In particular, we show that the four endpoints observed in the three
distributions m^2\_{ll}, m^2\_{jln} U m^2\_{jlf} and m^2\_{jln}+m^2\_{jlf} are
sufficient to completely pin down the squark mass and the two neutralino
masses, leaving only a discrete 2-fold ambiguity for the slepton mass. This
remaining ambiguity can be easily resolved in a number of different ways: for
example, by a single additional measurement of the kinematic endpoint of any
one out of the many remaining 1-dimensional distributions at our disposal, or
by exploring the correlations in the 2-dimensional distribution of m^2\_{jln} U
m^2\_{jlf} versus m^2\_{ll}. We illustrate our method with two examples: the LM1
and LM6 CMS study points. An additional advantage of our method is the expected
improvement in the accuracy of the SUSY mass determination, due to the
multitude and variety of available measurements.},

	abstract = {Human germ-cell tumors (GCTs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. Based on epidemiology, anatomical site of presentation, histology, chromosomal constitution, and pattern of genomic imprinting, GCTs are classified into five entities. Within the testis, three types of GCTs can be diagnosed: type I (teratomas and yolk-sac tumors of neonates and infants); type II (seminomas and nonseminomas); type III (spermatocytic seminomas). Here the focus is on the type II GCTs, the most frequent type in the adult testis (so-called TGCTs). They can also be diagnosed in dysgenetic gonads (an incomplete or defective formation of the gonad, caused by a disturbed process of migration of the germ cells and/or their correct organization in their fetal gonadal ridge), the anterior mediastinum, and pineal/suprasellar region. In the testis, they originate from the malignant counterpart of primordial germ cells/gonocytes, referred to as carcinoma in situ (CIS)/intratubular germ-cell neoplasia unclassified (ITGCNU). CIS/ITGCNU and seminomatous cells are characterized by expression of OCT3/4 and NANOG, while in addition embryonal carcinoma expresses SOX2, all identified as transcription factors related to pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. With the exception of teratomas, most histological elements of TGCTs are sensitive for (cisplatin-based) chemotherapy; CIS/ITGCNU and seminoma cells are also sensitive to DNA damage induced by irradiation. Similar observations have been made for ES cells and their derivates. Moreover, the genetic constitution of TGCTs (low incidence of mutations and frequent uniparental disomies) can also be linked to characteristics of ES cells, likely related to their specific inability to repair DNA damage and their high sensitivity to apoptotic cell death. The unusual presence of wild-type P53 in TGCTs is explained by specific expression of a cluster of micro-RNAs (miRNAs), that is, hsa-miR 371-373, also expressed in ES cells, which prevents P53-driven cellular senescence upon oncogenic stress. Many characteristics of human TGCTs reflect the nonmalignant counterparts from which they originate. Demonstration of these characteristics, in combination with the knowledge of the abnormal niche of these cells, normally occupied by spermatogonia, allows an informative method for (early) diagnosis. The conclusion is that TGCTs are embryonic cancers found in adults.},

This is pursued for the practical range of behavior in which unbinding occurs diffusively rather than ballistically, building on the classic work of Kramers. For a bond represented by a one-dimensional energy landscape, modified by a second time-dependent energy profile representing applied loading, we present a mathematical analysis showing the dependence of the resistance of the bond-on-bond well shape, general time dependence of the imposed loading, and stiffness of the loading apparatus.

	abstract = {Vesicle membranes with two coexisting fluid phases can exhibit a variety of domain patterns. These patterns and the associated vesicle shapes are studied theoretically by minimization of energy functionals that depend on the membrane composition and on the material parameters of the membrane. The latter parameters are (i) the bending rigidities and (ii) the Gaussian curvature moduli of the two types of membrane domains as well as (iii) the line tension of the domain boundaries. It is shown that the interplay between these different parameters leads to stable multi-domain patterns with more than two domains for a wide range of membrane composition and material parameters. As the membrane composition or the material parameters are varied, the vesicles can undergo transitions between different patterns of membrane domains. For fixed vesicle volume, an additional domain-induced transition is observed, in which the vesicle shape changes even though the domain pattern does not. The different multi-domain patterns and vesicle shapes are summarized in terms of morphology diagrams.},

@article{citeulike:4668248,
	abstract = {Motivation: A variety of algorithms have been developed to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within the genome by exploiting the evolutionary information implicit in multiple alignments of the genomes of related species. One such approach uses an extension of the standard position-specific motif model that incorporates phylogenetic information via a phylogenetic tree and a model of evolution. However, these phylogenetic motif models (PMMs) have never been rigorously benchmarked in order to determine whether they lead to better prediction of TFBSs than obtained using simple position weight matrix scanning.  Results: We evaluate three PMM-based prediction algorithms, each of which uses a different treatment of gapped alignments, and we compare their prediction accuracy with that of a non-phylogenetic motif scanning approach. Surprisingly, all of these algorithms appear to be inferior to simple motif scanning, when accuracy is measured using a gold standard of validated yeast TFBSs. However, the PMM scanners perform much better than simple motif scanning when we abandon the gold standard and consider the number of statistically significant sites predicted, using column-shuffled  random' motifs to measure significance. These results suggest that the common practice of measuring the accuracy of binding site predictors using collections of known sites may be dangerously misleading since such collections may be missing  weak' sites, which are exactly the type of sites needed to discriminate among predictors. We then extend our previous theoretical model of the statistical power of PMM-based prediction algorithms to allow for loss of binding sites during evolution, and show that it gives a more accurate upper bound on scanner accuracy. Finally, utilizing our theoretical model, we introduce a new method for predicting the number of real binding sites in a genome. The results suggest that the number of true sites for a yeast TF is in general several times greater than the number of known sites listed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Database (SCPD). Among the three scanning algorithms that we test, the MONKEY algorithm has the highest accuracy for predicting yeast TFBSs.  Contact: j.hawkins@imb.uq.edu.au 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp201},

	abstract = {Living cells display complex signal processing behaviors, many of which are mediated by networks of proteins specialized for signal transduction. Here we focus on the question of how the remarkably diverse array of eukaryotic signaling circuits may have evolved. Many of the mechanisms that connect signaling proteins into networks are highly modular: The core catalytic activity of a signaling protein is physically and functionally separable from molecular domains or motifs that determine its linkage to both inputs and outputs. This high degree of modularity may make these systems more evolvable-in principle, novel circuits, and therefore highly innovative regulatory behaviors, can arise from relatively simple genetic events such as recombination, deletion, or insertion. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies show that such modular systems can be exploited to engineer nonnatural signaling proteins and pathways with novel behavior.

@article{citeulike:580529,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:There has been a growing interest in computational discovery of regulatory elements, and a multitude of motif discovery methods have been proposed. Computational motif discovery has been used with some success in simple organisms like yeast. However, as we move to higher organisms with more complex genomes, more sensitive methods are needed. Several recent methods try to integrate additional sources of information, including microarray experiments (gene expression and ChIP-chip). There is also a growing awareness that regulatory elements work in combination, and that this combinatorial behavior must be modeled for successful motif discovery. However, the multitude of methods and approaches makes it difficult to get a good understanding of the current status of the field. RESULTS:This paper presents a survey of methods for motif discovery in DNA, based on a structured and well defined framework that integrates all relevant elements. Existing methods are discussed according to this framework. CONCLUSION:The survey shows that although no single method takes all relevant elements into consideration, a very large number of different models treating the various elements separately have been tried. Very often the choices that have been made are not explicitly stated, making it difficult to compare different implementations. Also, the tests that have been used are often not comparable. Therefore, a stringent framework and improved test methods are needed to evaluate the different approaches in order to conclude which ones are most promising. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Eugene V. Koonin, Philipp Bucher and Frank Eisenhaber.},

	abstract = {In plants, short RNAs including approximately 21-nt microRNA (miRNA) and 21-nt trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) compose a 'miRNA --> ta-siRNA --> target gene' cascade pathway that regulates gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In this cascade, biogenesis of ta-siRNA clusters requires 21-nt intervals (i.e. phasing) and miRNA (phase-initiator) cleavage sites on its TAS transcript. Here, we report a novel web server, pssRNAMiner, which is developed to identify both the clusters of phased small RNAs as well as the potential phase-initiator. To detect phased small RNA clusters, the pssRNAMiner maps input small RNAs against user-specified transcript/genomic sequences, and then identifies phased small RNA clusters by evaluating P-values of hypergeometric distribution. To identify potential phase-initiators, pssRNAMiner aligns input phase-initiators with transcripts of TAS candidates using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Potential cleavage sites on TAS candidates are further identified from complementary regions by weighting the alignment expectation and its distance to detected phased small RNA clusters. The pssRNAMiner web server is freely available at http://bioinfo3.noble.org/pssRNAMiner/.},

We report here an investigation of DNA copy number changes in GCTs using 1 Mb BAC arrays. As expected, 12p gain was the defining genomic alteration, occurring in 72/74 GCTs. Parallel expression profiling of these tumors identified potential oncogenes from gained regions (LYN and RAB25) and potential tumor suppressor genes in regions of loss (SYNPO2, TTC12, IGSF4, and EPB41L3). Notably, we observed specific genomic alterations associated with histology, including gain of 17p11.2-q21.32 and loss of 2p25.3 in embryonal carcinoma, gain of 8p23.3-12 and loss of 5p15.33-35.3, 11q23.1-25, and 13q12.11-34 in seminoma, and gain of 1q31.3-42.3, 3p, 14q11.2-32.33, and 20q and loss of 8q11.1-23.1 in yolk sac tumors (YST). Many significant genes that mapped to these regions had previously been associated with specific histologies, such as EOMES (chr3) and BMP2 (chr20) in YST and SPRY2 (chr13) and SOX17 (chr8) in seminomas. Additionally, our results suggest a model in which histologic differentiation of GCTs may drive genomic evolution.},

Two properties of social annotations, namely  keyword  property and  structure  property are studied for this aim. The  keyword  property improves LMIR by concatenating all the annotations of a document to generate a summary of the document. The  structure  property can boost LMIR further when similarity among annotations and similarity among documents are taken into consideration simultaneously. The two properties of social annotations are leveraged for the use of language modeling with a mixture model named as "Language Annotation Model" (denoted as LAM).

@article{citeulike:4869925,
	abstract = {Following considerable research into quality-of-service-aware application programming interface design and QoS specification language development for multimedia systems, we present a survey and taxonomy of existing QoS specification languages. As computer and communication technology evolves, distributed multimedia applications are becoming ubiquitous, and quality of service (QoS) is becoming ever more integral to those applications. Because they consume so many resources (such as memory and bandwidth), multimedia applications need resource management at different layers of the communications protocol stack to ensure end-to-end service quality, and to regulate resource contention for equitable resource sharing. However, before an application can invoke any QoS-aware resource management mechanisms and policies - such as admission control, resource reservation, enforcement, and adaptation - it must specify its QoS requirements and the corresponding resource allocations. Furthermore, the application must describe how QoS should be scaled and adapted in cases of resource contention or resource scarcity during runtime. Our goal in this article is to systematically classify and compare the existing QoS specification languages that span several QoS layers with diverse properties. The provided taxonomy and the extensive analysis will give us a detailed look at the existing QoS specification languages along with their properties and relations.},

	abstract = {Severely birth-asphyxiated human infants develop delayed ("secondary") cerebral energy failure, which carries a poor prognosis, during the first few days of life. This study tested the hypothesis that mild hypothermia after severe transient cerebral hypoxia-ischemia decreases the severity of delayed energy failure in the newborn piglet. Six piglets underwent temporary occlusion of the common carotid arteries and hypoxemia. Resuscitation was started when cerebral [phosphocreatine (PCr)]/[inorganic phosphate (Pi)] as determined by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy had fallen almost to zero and [nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)]/[exchangeable phosphate pool (EPP)] had fallen below about 30\% of baseline. Rectal and tympanic temperatures were then reduced to 35 degrees C for 12 h after which normothermia (38.5 degrees C) was resumed. Spectroscopy results over the next 64 h were compared with previously established data from 12 piglets similarly subjected to transient cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, but maintained normothermic, and six sham-operated controls. The mean severity of the primary insult (judged by the time integral of depletion of [NTP]/[EPP]) was similar in the hypothermic and normothermic groups. In the normothermic group, [PCr]/[Pi] and [NTP]/[EPP] recovered after the acute insult and then fell again. Minimum values for these variables observed between 24 and 48 h were significantly higher in the hypothermic group and not significantly different from the control values (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). A large reduction in secondary energy failure relative to the extent of the primary insult was shown and no further fall in either [PCr]/[Pi] or [NTP]/[EPP] took place up to 64 h in the hypothermic piglets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Repertoire of an immune system is a set of antigen receptors each having a unique specificity to bind an antigen. In many vertebrate species, antigen receptors are produced via combinatorial arrangements of DNA segments in specialized immune cells. Due to this molecular mechanism, repertoire of vertebrate species is potentially very large. The diversity of repertoire is thought to guarantee recognition of most ill-causing micro-organisms. In invertebrate species however, similar editing of DNA segments has not been demonstrated to take place. Immune system of invertebrate species therefore seems to operate in a distinct manner from that of vertebrate species. Using an evolutionary model in which organisms struggle to fight infections, we attempt to understand why some species use a more diverse set of antigen receptors than others. Individuals in our model either use somatic DNA recombination to produce antigen receptors (as in vertebrates) or do not use such a mechanism (as in invertebrates). We found that individuals having an invertebrate-like immune system came to employ only a few antigen receptors to recognize a set of pathogens whereas those with a vertebrate-like immune system use a larger set of more specific antigen receptors to recognize the same set of pathogens. Our interpretation of this finding is that because the genetics of the immune system imposed different constraints on the evolutionary process, two distinct recognition strategies have been adapted by these species.},

Evolutionary-genomic studies show that natural selection is only one of the forces that shape genome evolution and is not quantitatively dominant, whereas non-adaptive processes are much more prominent than previously suspected. Major contributions of horizontal gene transfer and diverse selfish genetic elements to genome evolution undermine the Tree of Life concept. An adequate depiction of evolution requires the more complex concept of a network or 'forest' of life. There is no consistent tendency of evolution towards increased genomic complexity, and when complexity increases, this appears to be a non-adaptive consequence of evolution under weak purifying selection rather than an adaptation. Several universals of genome evolution were discovered including the invariant distributions of evolutionary rates among orthologous genes from diverse genomes and of paralogous gene family sizes, and the negative correlation between gene expression level and sequence evolution rate. Simple, non-adaptive models of evolution explain some of these universals, suggesting that a new synthesis of evolutionary biology might become feasible in a not so remote future.},

@article{citeulike:4651972,
	abstract = {Based on differences in morphology, photoreceptor-type usage and lens composition it has been proposed that complex eyes have evolved independently many times. The remarkable observation that different eye types rely on a conserved network of genes (including  Pax6 / eyeless ) for their formation has led to the revised proposal that disparate complex eye types have evolved from a shared and simpler prototype. Did this ancestral eye already contain the neural circuitry required for image processing? And what were the evolutionary events that led to the formation of complex visual systems, such as those found in vertebrates and insects? The recent identification of unexpected cell-type homologies between neurons in the vertebrate and  Drosophila  visual systems has led to two proposed models for the evolution of complex visual systems from a simple prototype. The first, as an extension of the finding that the neurons of the vertebrate retina share homologies with both insect (rhabdomeric) and vertebrate (ciliary) photoreceptor cell-types, suggests that the vertebrate retina is a composite structure, made up of neurons that have evolved from two spatially separate ancestral photoreceptor populations. The second model, based largely on the conserved role for the  Vsx  homeobox genes in photoreceptor-target neuron development, suggests that the ancestral eye already possessed a relatively sophisticated visual system that contained a mixture of rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptors as well as their first-and second-order target neurons. The vertebrate retina and fly visual system would have subsequently evolved by elaborating on this ancestral neural circuit. Here we present evidence for these two cell-type homology-based models and discuss their implications.},

	abstract = {Modules can be defined as quasi-autonomous units that are connected loosely with each other within a system. A need for the concept of modularity has emerged as we deal with evolving organisms in evolutionary developmental research, especially because it is unknown how genes are associated with anatomical patterns. One of the strategies to link genotypes with phenotypes could be to relate developmental modules with morphological ones. To do this, it is fundamental to grasp the context in which certain anatomical units and developmental processes are associated with each other specifically. By identifying morphological modularities as units recognized by some categories of general homology as established by comparative anatomy, it becomes possible to identify developmental modules whose genetic components exhibit coextensive expressions. This permits us to distinguish the evolutionary modification in which the identical morphological module simply alters its shape for adaptation, without being decoupled from the functioning gene network ('coupled modularities'), from the evolution of novelty that involves a heterotopic shift between the anatomical and developmental modules. Using this formulation, it becomes possible, within the realm of Geoffroy's homologous networks, to reduce morphological homologies to developmental mechanistic terms by dissociating certain classes of modules that are often associated with actual shapes and functions.},

We obtain high harmonics up to an energy of 5.5Up + Ip, surpassing the conventional limit of 3.17Up + Ip. For high intensities approaching the threshold for barrier suppression ionization, beyond which no harmonics are generated, this mechanism acquires practical importance as a means to overcome the limit imposed by saturation. We analyse the underlying mechanism using both classical and quantum approaches, and highlight the role of the shaped field in modifying the electron trajectories in the continuum to enhance the collection of kinetic energy from the driving field. Of greatest importance are the trajectories describing electrons ionized across the first peak of the laser field which receive the enhanced kinetic energies responsible for the cut-off extension above the conventional limit. Interestingly, the most energetic trajectories do not contribute to the harmonic cut-off in the single pulse case. We conclude with a discussion of the sub-cycle structure of the emitted harmonic radiation and possible applications of the technique.},

@article{citeulike:4613482,
	abstract = {New perspectives on the origin of neurogenesis emerged with the identification of genes encoding post-synaptic proteins as well as many  ” neurogenic” regulators as the NK, Six, Pax, bHLH proteins in the Demosponge genome, a species that might differentiate sensory cells but no neurons. However, poriferans seem to miss some key regulators of the neurogenic circuitry as the Hox/paraHox and Otx-like gene families. Moreover as a general feature, many gene families encoding evolutionarily-conserved signaling proteins and transcription factors were submitted to a wave of gene duplication in the last common eumetazoan ancestor, after Porifera divergence. In contrast gene duplications in the last common bilaterian ancestor, Urbilateria, are limited, except for the bHLH Atonal-class. Hence Cnidaria share with Bilateria a large number of genetic tools. The expression and functional analyses currently available suggest a neurogenic function for numerous orthologs in developing or adult cnidarians where neurogenesis takes place continuously. As an example, in the  Hydra  polyp, the  Clytia  medusa and the  Acropora  coral, the  Gsx/cnox2/Anthox-2  ParaHox gene likely supports neurogenesis. Also neurons and nematocytes (mechano-sensory cells) share in hydrozoans a common stem cell and several regulatory genes indicating that they can be considered as sister cells. Performed in anthozoan and medusozoan species, these studies should tell us more about the way(s) evolution hazards achieved the transition from epithelial to neuronal cell fate, and about the robustness of the genetic circuitry that allowed neuro-muscular transmission to arise and be maintained across evolution.},

Identifying sources of variation and assessing their magnitude, among other factors, are important for optimal experimental design. The objectives of this study were: (1) to estimate relative magnitudes of different sources of variation and (2) to evaluate agreement between biological and technical replicates. RESULTS: We performed a microarray experiment using a total of 24 Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. The study included 4th mammary gland samples from eight 21-day-old Sprague Dawley CD female rats exposed to genistein (soy isoflavone). RNA samples from each rat were split to assess variation arising at labeling and hybridization steps. A general linear model was used to estimate variance components. Pearson correlations were computed to evaluate agreement between technical and biological replicates. CONCLUSION: The greatest source of variation was biological variation, followed by residual error, and finally variation due to labeling when *.cel files were processed with dChip and RMA image processing algorithms. When MAS 5.0 or GCRMA-EB were used, the greatest source of variation was residual error, followed by biology and labeling.

@book{citeulike:4869773,
	abstract = {\_Overcoming Barriers to Student Learning \_explores why certain students "get
stuck" at particular points in the curriculum whilst others grasp concepts
with comparative ease. It proposes a "threshold concepts" approach to the
curriculum, arguing that in certain disciplines there are "conceptual
gateways" or "portals" that lead to previously inaccessible, and initially
perhaps "troublesome," ways of thinking about something. A new way of
understanding, interpreting, or viewing a topic may thus emerge - having a
transformative effect on internal view of subject matter, subject landscape,
or even world view.


While maintaining that knowledge should indeed be "troubling" in order for it
to be transformative, this book provides new perspectives on helping students
through such conceptual difficulty in order to enhance learning and teaching
environments in higher education, and in other educational sectors. It
discusses:


· ways of dealing with the kinds of anxiety, self-doubt and frustration that
learning can evoke in students

· how we might help our students not to avoid the troublesomeness, but to feel
more confident in coping with it, resolving it and moving on with confidence

· what might account for variation in student performance when dealing with
concepts

· what teachers might do in relation to the design and teaching of their
courses that could help students overcome such barriers to their learning

· what makes particular areas of knowledge more troublesome than others


The illustrative case studies presented here will help teachers analyze their
own practice. \_Overcoming Barriers to Student Learning\_ will serve the needs
of educational researchers and developers, and academics within various
disciplines who wish to learn more about threshold concepts and troublesome
knowledge.},

	abstract = {We previously demonstrated that the major immediate early (MIE) proximal enhancer containing one GC box and the TATA box containing promoter are minimal elements required for transcription and viral replication in human fibroblast cells (H. Isomura, T. Tsurumi, M. F. Stinski, J. Virol. 78:12788-12799, 2004). After infection, the level of Sp1 increased while Sp3 remained constant. Here we report that either Sp1 or Sp3 transcription factors bind to the GC boxes located at approximately positions -55 and -75 relative to the transcription start site (+1). Both the Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites have a positive and synergistic effect on the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate-early (MIE) promoter. There was little to no change in MIE transcription or viral replication for recombinant viruses with one or the other Sp1 or Sp3 binding site mutated. In contrast, mutation of both the Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites caused inefficient MIE transcription and viral replication. These data indicate that the Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites have a significant role in HCMV replication in human fibroblast cells. 10.1128/JVI.79.15.9597-9607.2005},

	abstract = {The parameters of EPR signal from dinitrosyl–iron complexes (DNIC) with bovine serum albumin (BSA), horse hemoglobin (Hb), and apometallothionein (apo-Mt) of horse kidney incorporating one (BSA, Hb) or two thiol-containing ligands (apo-Mt) were compared. The EPR signal from DNIC–BSA was characterized by the rhombic symmetry of g tensor at room temperature of signal recording (ambient temperature) or at 77K in the solution frozen in the presence of glycerol. In freezing of the solution in the absence of glycerin, under the exposure of DNIC–BSA to negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ions, or in the incorporation of DNIC–BSA into the reversed micelles formed by negatively charged ions of surfactant aerosol OT, the symmetry of the g tensor of DNIC–BSA EPR signal increased to axial. A similarly high symmetry of g tensor was observed for the DNIC–Hb EPR signal in the absence of any influence on this protein complex. The shape of EPR signals from these preparations recorded at 77K was identical to that of EPR signal from DNIC with cysteine in frozen solution. In this connection it was concluded that the EPR signal from this low-molecular DNIC with the (RS − ) 2 Fe + (NO + ) 2 structure cannot be considered as a peculiar  ” fingerprint” of DNIC with the same structure in biosystems. In such systems the same signal can originate from protein DNIC incorporating only one thiol-containing ligand along with a nonthiol ligand. The EPR signal displayed by DNIC with apo-Mt with a high content of cysteine residues at room temperature of registration was identical to the EPR signal from frozen solution of DNIC with cysteine. This protein DNIC is apparently characterized by the same structure as DNIC with cysteine.},

The main goal of the analysis is the evaluation of the effects that a graded sediment has on the formation of the bottom forms and the investigation of the sorting process induced by the growth of the bottom forms. The analysis is based on the study of the stability of the flat bed configuration, i.e. small amplitude perturbations are added to the flat bottom and a linear analysis of their time development is made. For an oscillatory tidal current dominated by one tidal constituent, the results show that the graded sediment can stabilize or destabilize the flat bottom configuration with respect to the uniform sediment case, depending on the standard deviation *. The results are physically interpreted and provide a possible explanation of the apparently conflicting field observations of the grain size distribution along the sand wave profile, carried out in the North Sea.},

spin fluctuation theories, is very fragile against impurities. In the BCS
theory, only 1\% impurities induce huge pair-breaking, resulting in the large
in-gap state and prominent reduction in Tc, contrary to the prediction based on
simple orbital-less models. The present study provides a useful constraint on
the pairing symmetry and the electronic states in iron pnictides.},

	abstract = {Stochastic discrete-event simulation has become one of the most-used tools for performance evaluation in science and engineering. But no innovation can replace the responsibility of simulators for obtaining credible results from their simulation experiments. In this paper we address the problem of the statistical correctness of simulation output data analysis, in the context of sequential steady-state stochastic simulation, conducted for studying long run behavior of stable systems. Such simulations are stopped as soon as the relative precision of estimates, defined as the relative half-width of confidence intervals at a specified confidence level, reaches the required level. We formulate basic rules for the proper experimental analysis of the coverage of steady-state interval estimators. Our main argument is that such an analysis should be done sequentially. The numerical results of our coverage analysis of the method of non-overlapping batch means and spectral analysis are presented, and compared with those obtained by the traditional, non-sequential approach. Two scenarios for stochastic simulation are considered: traditional sequential simulation on a single processor, and fast concurrent simulation based on multiple replications in parallel (MRIP), with multiple processors cooperating in the production of output data.},

PMP is a clinical condition characterized by disseminated intraperitoneal mucinous tumours often accompanied by mucinous ascites derived usually from an appendiceal neoplasm. Patients with PMP have traditionally been treated by serial debulking, but aggressive cytoreduction followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is now advocated as standard treatment in PMP. Methods: The analysis included 33 consecutive patients with PMP who underwent traditional debulking surgery between June 1984 and August 2008. The patient characteristics and details of the treatment were analysed retrospectively. The primary endpoint was survival. Results: The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 67\% and 31\%, respectively. The patients underwent an average of 3.2 +/- 0.4 operations (range 1-10). Of 33 patients, 23 (70\%) underwent only 1-3 operations. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 2.7\%. However, four patients (12\%) seemed to have achieved long-term disease-free survival of more than 5 years. Conclusions: The 5-year survival is comparable with results achieved in patients receiving a combination of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but in the long term the latter seems superior.},

Methods.  Surgical biopsy specimens of subcutaneous adipose tissue were obtained from 18 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV‐1)–infected lipoatrophic patients (the LA+ group) who were treated with either zidovudine (the AZT+LA+ group; \$n=10\$ ) or stavudine (the d4T+LA+ group; \$n=8\$ ) and from 10 nonlipoatrophic HIV‐1–infected patients (the LA− group) who received antiretroviral therapy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers, gene expression, and immunohistochemistry data were analyzed. Results.  mtDNA copy numbers were significantly reduced in the LA+ group, compared with the LA− group, and in the d4T+LA+ group, compared with the AZT+LA+ group. The ratio of mtDNA‐encoded cytochrome COX3 to nuclear DNA–encoded COX4 expression was significantly lower in the LA+ group than in the LA− group. Compared with the LA− group, the LA+ group had significantly lower expression of genes involved in adipogenesis (SREBP1c and CEBPB), lipid (fatty acid synthase), and glucose (GLUT4) metabolism. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1B), apoptosis (FAS), inflammation (IL1B), oxidative stress (PCNA and SOD1), and lamin B was significantly higher in the LA+ group than in the LA− group. The d4T+LA+ group had significantly lower expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (POLG1), energy metabolism (the COX3/COX4 ratio), adipogenesis (SREBP1c and CEBPA), perilipin, and hexokinase than did the AZT+LA+ group. There were 7‐fold more macrophages in adipose tissue specimens obtained from patients in the LA+ group, compared with the LA− group. Conclusions.  Lipoatrophy is characterized by mtDNA depletion, inflammation, and signs of apoptosis. Changes were more profound in the d4T+LA+ group than in the AZT+LA+ group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Trophoblast invasion is crucial to placentation. The relationship between decidual glycodelin-A and trophoblast invasion is not known. METHODS Invasiveness of First trimester extravillous cytotrophoblast-1 (TEV-1) cell line, TEV-1, cells was determined by trans-well invasion assay. The gene expression, protein secretion and activities of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) of glycodelin-A-treated cells were measured by quantitative PCR, ELISA and gel zymography, respectively. RESULTS Glycodelin-A bound to TEV-1 cells. At a concentration of 1 microg/ml, glycodelin-A, but not other glycodelin isoforms, suppressed the invasion of TEV-1 cells. The effect was glycosylation-dependent and was associated with reduction (P < 0.05) of MMP2, MMP9 and uPA activities in the conditioned medium from the treated culture. Glycodelin-A treatment suppressed the amount of MMP2 protein in the conditioned medium (P < 0.05) and MMP2 mRNA in the cells (P < 0.05), but did not affect that of MMP9. Glycodelin-A also significantly reduced the expression, secretion and activity of uPA (P < 0.05). The treatment did not affect the expression of TIMP-1, TIMP-2 or PAI-1, cell proliferation or survival of the cells. CONCLUSIONS Glycodelin-A inhibits the invasion of extravillous cytotrophoblasts mainly by suppressing the activity of MMP2 and MMP9 in a glycosylation-dependent fashion.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cerebral hypoperfusion caused by large vessel atherosclerosis has been suggested to be associated with the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Atherosclerosis and AD share risk factors such as age, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) allele. We studied the association between atherosclerosis of the circle of Willis (CW) and AD neuropathology in a large autopsy sample. Methods: The present study comprised a consecutive autopsy series (n = 466) representing noninstitutionalized general population aged 50 years and over (mean 70.8, SD 11.5 years). The atherosclerosis of CW was scored semiquantitatively and the amyloid plaque (AP) load in the frontal cortex and the number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the hippocampus were measured. Results: In a linear regression model, AP percentage area was associated with age (p < 0.0001) and APOE epsilon4 allele (p < 0.0001), but not with CW score (p = 0.70) or gender (p = 0.11). Similarly, the NFT count was predicted only by age (p > 0.0001), and not by CW score (p = 0.36), gender (p = 0.41) or APOE epsilon4 allele (p = 0.072). Conclusion: Our results suggest that cerebral large vessel atherosclerosis is not in direct association with APs or NFTs - hallmarks of AD neuropathology.},

We perform segregation analyses to identify the best fitting genetic model for gestational age, a quantitative proxy for preterm birth. Methods: Because either mother or infant can be considered the proband from a preterm delivery and there is evidence to suggest that genetic factors in either one or both may influence the trait, we performed segregation analysis for gestational age either attributed to the infant (infant's gestational age), or the mother (by averaging the gestational ages at which her children were delivered), using 96 multiplex preterm families. Results: These data lend further support to a genetic component contributing to birth timing since sporadic (i.e. no familial resemblance) and nontransmission (i.e. environmental factors alone contribute to gestational age) models are strongly rejected. Analyses of gestational age attributed to the infant support a model in which mother's genome and/or maternally-inherited genes acting in the fetus are largely responsible for birth timing, with a smaller contribution from the paternally-inherited alleles in the fetal genome. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that genetic influences on birth timing are important and likely complex.},

@article{citeulike:4869659,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the association between estimated GFR (eGFR) at the start of dialysis and mortality within Europe. METHODS: Renal registries participating in the ERA-EDTA Registry were asked to provide data on serum creatinine recorded 0-4 weeks before the start of dialysis in incident dialysis patients in 1999 and 2003. Within this cohort study, data were available in 11 472 patients from nine national or regional European renal registries. Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association between GFR estimated by the four-variable MDRD equation (eGFR) and all-cause mortality, using a follow-up through 31 December 2005. RESULTS: In the 2003 data, the mean eGFR was 8.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The unadjusted survival analyses showed that an increase in eGFR of 1 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR = 1.03; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.04) that remained similar after adjustment for age, gender, primary renal disease, treatment modality, country and comorbidity. The findings were consistent across gender, treatment modalities, geographical regions and time periods (2003 versus 1999), but the association between a higher eGFR at the start of dialysis and mortality was the strongest in the youngest age groups and in patients with glomerulonephritis. Analyses at centre level showed that a 10\% increase in the percentage of patients starting dialysis at high eGFR levels (>/=10.5 ml/min) was associated with a 22\% higher mortality risk (HR = 1.22; 95\% CI: 1.18-1.26). CONCLUSIONS: This European study showed that a higher eGFR at the start of dialysis was associated with a higher mortality risk. However, an answer to the question when to start dialysis needs to come from randomized controlled trials.},

Defining suitable computational techniques for development modelling, able to perform in silico simulation experiments, is an open and challenging problem.  Results: Previously, we proposed a coarse-grained, quantitative approach based on the basic Petri net formalism, to mimic the behaviour of the biological processes during multicellular differentiation. Here we apply our modelling approach to the well-studied process of C. elegans vulval development. We show that our model correctly reproduces a large set of in vivo experiments with statistical accuracy. It also generates gene expression time series in accordance with recent biological evidence. Finally, we modelled the role of microRNA mir-61 during vulval development and predict its contribution in stabilising cell pattern formation.

However, the optimal schematic regimen of substitutive medication to prevent thromboembolic events after surgery is unsettled. Methods\&nbsp;\&nbsp;We report five complex neurosurgical cases with high risk for thromboembolism requiring thromboprophylaxis during craniotomy. Clinical feature\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In one patient with coronary bare metal stent and antiplatelet therapy, acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel was discontinued 5 and 11\&nbsp;days prior to surgery, respectively. Four other patients were on regular warfarin therapy due to previous deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or mechanical aortic valve. Adjusted bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin was applied in all cases. The patient with the coronary stent who was managed with reduced-dose dalteparin developed postoperative intracranial hemorrhage despite having platelet and fresh-frozen plasma transfusions, and the patient did not survive. Another patient with a history of lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma but also a recurrence of left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and had a delayed recovery. The other two patients with history of pulmonary embolism, and one patient having mechanical aortic valve and atrial fibrillation, recovered uneventfully when reduced doses of low molecular weight heparin bridging therapy were administered. Conclusion\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Our observations confirm the complexity of balancing the risks of bleeding and thrombosis in neurosurgical patients on antithrombotic medication. In these patients, the individual bleeding risk is likely minimized by the administration of reduced doses of LMWH relatively late after craniotomy and by delaying the start of warfarin after surgery.},

It is an unresolved problem how this specific spatiotemporal organization of replication foci is determined. Another unresolved question remains as to what extent DNA is redistributed during S phase. To investigate these problems, we visualized the replicating DNA and the replication machinery simultaneously in living HeLa cells. Time-lapse analyses revealed that DNA was not redistributed to other nuclear sites during S phase. Furthermore, the results showed that DNA is organized into stable aggregates equivalent to replication foci. These aggregates, which we call sub-chromosomal foci, stably maintained their replication timing from S phase to S phase. During S-phase progression, the replication machinery sequentially proceeded through spatially adjacent sets of sub-chromosomal foci. These findings imply that the specific nuclear substructure of chromosomes and the order of their stable subunits determine the spatiotemporal organization of DNA replication.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Biological function of biomolecules is accompanied by a wide range of motional behavior. Accurate modeling of dynamics by molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations is therefore a useful approach toward the understanding of biomolecular function. NMR spin relaxation measurements provide rigorous benchmarks for assessing important aspects of MD simulations, such as the amount and time scales of conformational space sampling, which are intimately related to the underlying molecular mechanics force field. Until recently, most simulations produced trajectories that exhibited too much dynamics particularly in flexible loop regions. Recent modifications made to the backbone and torsion angle potentials of the AMBER and CHARMM force fields indicate that these changes produce more realistic molecular dynamics behavior. To assess the consequences of these changes, we performed a series of 5-20 ns molecular dynamics trajectories of human ubiquitin using the AMBER99 and AMBER99SB force fields for different conditions and water models and compare the results with NMR experimental backbone N-H S2 order parameters. A quantitative analysis of the trajectories shows significantly improved agreement with experimental NMR data for the AMBER99SB force field as compared to AMBER99. Because NMR spin relaxation data (T1, T2, NOE) reflect the combined effects of spatial and temporal fluctuations of bond vectors, it is found that comparison of experimental and back-calculated NMR spin-relaxation data provides a more objective way of assessing the quality of the trajectory than order parameters alone. Analysis of a key mobile -hairpin in ubiquitin demonstrates that the dynamics of mobile sites are not only reduced by the modified force field, but the extent of motional correlations between amino acids is also markedly diminished.},

	abstract = {The parent compounds of the recently discovered iron-arsenic (pnictide) high
temperature superconductors transition into an intriguing spin density wave
(SDW) phase at low temperatures. Progress in understanding this SDW state has
been complicated by a complex band structure and by the fact that the spin,
electronic, and structural degrees of freedom are closely intertwined in these
compounds. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements have added to this
complexity by revealing different topographies with no consensus on the surface
structure. In this paper, we use a combination of high-resolution STM imaging
and spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to determine the
atomic and electronic structure of the parent pnictide SrFe2As2. Our data
present a compelling picture of the existence of two coexisting homotopic
structures on the surface. Based on this, we construct a simple model for the
surface, which offers an explanation of the two classes of topographies seen by
STM. STM spectroscopy shows that while the high energy density of states (DOS)
profile is consistent with the Fe 3d and As 4p-electrons predicted by LDA it is
in better agreement with calculations that include electron correlations beyond
LDA. Importantly, we find a gap of \~{}15 meV in the low energy density of states

The LER sequence is statistically generated by a Fourier analysis of the power spectrum of the Gaussian autocorrelation function. The results show that SBFETs are more sensitive to the LER effect in the high-<formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">\$V\_{rm gs}\$</tex> </formula> region and less sensitive in the subthreshold region compared with DG FinFETs. The aggressive fluctuation of drive current can be attributed to the variation of tunneling barrier width. Lowering the Schottky-barrier height and increasing the silicon-body thickness can suppress the parameter fluctuations from the LER effect. The simulation also shows that a 6T SRAM cell consisting of SBFETs is more vulnerable to noise disturbance than its counterpart consisting of FinFETs, particularly for the read operation, which is due to a larger mismatch of drivability of SBFETs within the cell. </para>},

	abstract = {In a cloud computing context, the MapReduce algorithm comprises two massively parallel operations linked by a generic sorting and data-distribution process. Although this algorithm is the workhorse in most cloud computing strategies, it's a special case of a more general dataflow. In place of the two cloud operations, the proposed method substitutes longer sequences and then lets the user direct outputs to any subsequent downstream operation. However, the method retains the job-supervisor infrastructure, which performs the necessary sorting, collating, and distributing of these outputs prior to initiating operations. To evaluate SQL database queries, particularly those with correlated subqueries, a computation identifies and aligns data elements from widely separated storage locations, suggesting cloud algorithms that exploit the supervisory sorting process to achieve the desired alignments. Exploring such algorithms reveals that a few customizable templates, assembled recursively as necessary, can handle a wide class of SQL data-mining queries.},

Since the late Sixties, control of our economy has passed into the hands of a
new elite of super-rich free-market operatives and their colleagues in
national and international institutions. These New Olympians, so named because
of their remoteness from everyday life and their lack of accountability, are
unconcerned with — in fact, hostile to — job security, social tranquility and
the traditional middle-class aspiration for both the good life and the quiet
life.

This group has sought to insulate itself from democratic challenge and to make
 ” irreversible” the legal changes from which it has profited so enormously.
Aside from the obnoxious principles involved, the rule of this financial elite
has brought not prosperity but sluggish growth in living standards, a debt
explosion, and now a major crisis of international proportions as a vast
borrowing bubble starts to deflate.

Because hemodynamic evaluation of AI may potentially predict the effects of an insufficient valve on the ventricle before they occur, it would be useful to guide valve surgery with such a diagnostic tool. The purpose of this study was to test the performance of a new hemodynamic index based on mechanical energy loss for the measurement of the effects of insufficiency on ventricular workload. An intact and subsequently perforated aortic bioprosthesis was tested within an  in vitro  model of the left heart, varying cardiac output, diastolic aortic pressure, and the size of perforation. Regurgitant orifice area ( ROA ), regurgitant volume ( RV ), regurgitant fraction ( RF ), and energy loss index ( ELI ) were measured for each experimental condition and plotted against the increase in workload per unit volume net forward flow (Δ WPV ) due to perforation.  ROA ,  RV , and  RF  showed good correlations with Δ WPV , but the relationship between these variables and Δ WPV  became ambiguous as their magnitudes increased.  ELI  had a near perfect linear relationship with Δ WPV  (slope=1.00,  r 2 =0.98) independent of the experimental condition. RV ,  RF , and  ROA  do not by themselves fully describe the increase in difficulty the ventricle has in moving the blood across an insufficient valve.  ELI , in contrast, was found to be a very good measure of the decrease in pump efficiency due to aortic valve insufficiency.},

turn. The most influential change in economic and social regulation has seen a
dramatic reprise of liberal faith in less regulated markets and minimalist
states, underpinned by advocacy for extending exclusive property rights to
nearly everything imaginable. This complex turn, with its countless yet

by the contentious concept of neoliberalism. Today, neoliberalism provides the
context and direction for how humans affect and interact with the non-human
world and with one another. But what does this mean for nature?

This volume brings together specific case studies that span more than two
decades of experience and evidence linking neoliberalism with concrete
environmental changes, politics, and outcomes in diverse, international
contexts. It evaluates specific political ecologies and dynamics, and the
implications of particular neoliberal reforms and enforcements, while
collectively affording new contributors and readers the possibility of
thinking comparatively across sectors and geographic contexts. Such

attempts to answer these questions by exploring neoliberalism's origins and

Although modern neoliberalism was born at the  ” Colloque Walter Lippmann” in
1938, it only came into its own with the founding of the Mont P\`{e}lerin Society,
a partisan  ” thought collective,” in Vevey, Switzerland, in 1947. Its original
membership was made up of transnational economists and intellectuals,
including Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Karl Popper,
Michael Polanyi, and Luigi Einaudi. From this small beginning, their ideas
spread throughout the world, fostering, among other things, the political
platforms of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan and the Washington Consensus.

\_The Road from Mont P\`{e}lerin\_ presents the key debates and conflicts that
occurred among neoliberal scholars and their political and corporate allies
regarding trade unions, development economics, antitrust policies, and the
influence of philanthropy. The book captures the depth and complexity of the
neoliberal  ” thought collective” while examining the numerous ways that
neoliberal discourse has come to shape the global economy.},

complete and analytical account of the Neo-liberal conception of the role and
function of the state in modern society. The second aim is to provide a
critical assessment of some of the central elements of this conception. The
book will look at the emphasis of Neo-liberals on procedural and rule governed
approaches to the role of the state rather than outcome or end state views of
the role of government and to consider how this conception of politics relates
to issues such as the rule of law, freedom, justice, rights, the relationship
to the market economy, to civil society and to look at the role of government
in relation to the provision of welfare and public sector services more
generally. It builds up the Neo-liberal case in respect of these aspects of
modern society by drawing upon the works of central Neo-liberal thinkers such
as Hayek, Mises, Menger, as well as thinkers such as Oakeshott, Nozick and
Rotbard who are not directly Neo-liberals but whose works have been important
for the development of central Neo-liberal themes. The second part of the book
provides what might be regarded as an immanent critique of the Neo-liberal
case built up in the first part of the study. It takes Neo-liberal ideas very
seriously and shows how incoherences arise within and between those ideas such
that a plausible form of Neo-liberalism as opposed to Libertarianism on the
one hand and Social Democracy on the other is very difficult to state. The
theme of this book is very germane given the considerable debate which is now
taking place in the context of the world financial crisis about the

	abstract = {Thromboembolism and the attendant risk of cardioembolic stroke remains an impediment to the development of prosthetic cardiovascular devices. In particular, altered haemodynamics are implicated in the acute blood cell damage that leads to thromboembolic complications, with platelet activation being the underlying mechanism for cardioemboli formation in blood flow past mechanical heart valves (MHVs) and other blood re-circulating devices. In this work, a new modeling paradigm for evaluating the cardioembolic risk of MHVs is described. In silico fluid–structure interaction (FSI) approach is used for providing a realistic representation of the flow through a bileaflet MHV model, and a Lagrangian analysis is adopted for characterizing the mechanism of mechanically induced activation of platelets by means of a mathematical model for platelet activation state prediction. Additionally, the relationship between the thromboembolic potency of the device and the local flow dynamics is quantified by giving a measure of the role played by the local streamwise and spanwise vorticity components. Our methodology indicates that (i) mechanically induced activation of platelets when passing through the valve is dependent on the phase of the cardiac cycle, where the platelet rate of activation is lower at early systole than late systole; (ii) local spanwise vorticity has greater influence on the activation of platelets ( R ≥0.94) than streamwise vorticity ( R ≥0.78). In conclusion, an integrated Lagrangian description of key flow characteristics could provide a more complete and quantitative picture of blood flow through MHVs and its potential to activate platelets: the proposed  ” comprehensive scale” approach could represent an efficient and novel assessment tool for MHV performance and may possibly lead to improved valve designs.},

@book{citeulike:4869538,
	abstract = {The shift in the ideological winds toward a "free-market" economy has brought
profound effects in urban areas. The Neoliberal City presents an overview of
the effect of these changes on today's cities. The term "neoliberalism" was
originally used in reference to a set of practices that first-world
institutions like the IMF and World Bank impose on third-world countries and
cities. The support of unimpeded trade and individual freedoms and the
discouragement of state regulation and social spending are the putative
centerpieces of this vision. More and more, though, people have come to
recognize that first-world cities are undergoing the same processes.

In The Neoliberal City, Jason Hackworth argues that neoliberal policies are in
fact having a profound effect on the nature and direction of urbanization in
the United States and other wealthy countries, and that much can be learned
from studying its effect. He explores the impact that neoliberalism has had on
three aspects of urbanization in the United States: governance, urban form,
and social movements. The American inner city is seen as a crucial battle zone
for the wider neoliberal transition primarily because it embodies
neoliberalism's antithesis, Keynesian egalitarian liberalism. Focusing on
issues such as gentrification in New York City; public-housing policy in New
York, Chicago, and Seattle; downtown redevelopment in Phoenix; and urban-
landscape change in New Brunswick, N.J., Hackworth shows us how material and
symbolic changes to institutions, neighborhoods, and entire urban regions can
be traced in part to the rise of neoliberalism.},

@book{citeulike:4869534,
	abstract = {Neo-liberalism is one of the most influential ideologies since the Second
World War, yet little research has been devoted to the movement of ideas that
constitute its main body of thought. This book fills the void, providing an
original account of neo-liberalism's intellectual foundations, development,
and conceptual configuration as an ideology.

It presents a comparative study of the development and the nature of neo-
liberal ideas in the national contexts of Germany, Britain and the United
States since the twentieth century, addressing the following questions:

What are neo-liberalism's intellectual origins?

What influence did neo-liberalism have on public policy debates?

What are neo-liberalism's core concepts and how have they been interpreted in
different national contexts that make it a distinctive ideology?

In answering these questions, the book provides a deeper insight into the
historical and intellectual origins and conceptual configuration of an
ideology that reshaped politics and societies across the world.

Key Features:

Explores the intellectual and historical genesis of neo-liberalism

Presents a case study of ideological growth and formation

Concentrates on the four core concepts at the centre of neo-liberal ideology:
the market, welfare, the constitution and property

Written in a clear and accessible style

Offers a comprehensive analysis of neo-liberalism as both an ideology and a
political movement},

The NH3 horizontal fluxes and the cumulated deposition were assessed with mass-balance masts located at different distances from the source. Thirty acid-coated denuders were placed between x=12 and 162 m, where x is the downwind distance from the source. Standard micro-meteorological variables as well as canopy-specific variables were measured. Eight series of measurements are reported in total. The measured concentration decreased sharply from between 30 and 550 [mu]g NH3 m-3 at x=12 m to between 2 and 23 [mu]g NH3 m-3 at x=162 m. Wind speed profiles are comparable to previously reported measurements within and above canopies, and temperature profiles exhibit unstable stratification at the top and the bottom of the canopy, but seem to show a temperature inversion within the canopy. The mass balance estimate of the total horizontal flux at x=12 m compares well with the source strength, although this indicates an overestimation of the mass balance method, since the flux above the mast was not taken into account. The cumulated deposition between x=12 m and 162 m was estimated to range between 5 and 30\% of the emitted NH3, although the mass balance technique was proved to be very uncertain due to difficulties in estimating both vertical and horizontal fluxes. The dataset presented here constitutes a reference against which within-canopy short-range NH3 deposition models can be validated, and sensitivity studies can be done to better understand the underlying processes.},

high for the ignition of nuclear reactions. This is potentially an important

dissipation is considered to be the only heating mechanism, while the heating
caused by nuclear reactions is not considered. In this paper, we investigate
whether the energy generation rate of nuclear reaction is important compared to
the viscous heating. Our calculation indicates that the former is at most one
percent of the latter and thus is not important. The dynamics of accretion flow
can be therefore calculated in the usual way, without the need to consider
heating due to nuclear reactions.},

@book{citeulike:4869510,
	abstract = {This volume offers a critical examination of the growing pressure to apply
scientific principles as a means to improve education. The authors trace the
ideology of scientism to the early faith Auguste Comte placed in science and
the scientific method as a panacea to all human problem solving.

By revealing many of the epistemological problems confronted by the social
sciences, including education, the authors undermine the prevailing view that
a science of education is possible or desirable. Besides revealing the
epistemological problems associated with education research, they suggest that
the instrumentalism and micro level responsibility related to scientism in
education constitute a manipulative ideological smokescreen to distract public
attention away from the structural inequities that generate disparate academic
outcomes among students in industrialized democracies. The book deals a severe
blow to the belief that science is a suitable lens through which to view or
strengthen educational practice.

"One begins this book with the skeptical belief that it can't be right. The
task of reading, then, is to locate where Hyslop-Margison goes wrong to reach
his radical and disturbing conclusions. At the very least, even the most
skeptical will have to recognize that the unsayable—that current educational
research has proven largely fruitless for discernable reasons—is certainly
plausible. He brilliantly brings an issue that has been considered too
eccentric to contemplate into the heart of current educational discourse.
Everyone concerned with educational research—researchers and those policy-
makers, administrators, and other educational workers who draw on the products
of educational research should read this important book carefully."

sources by the INTEGRAL satellite (IGR sources). The purpose of the Chandra
observations is to localize the sources and to measure their soft X-ray spectra
in order to determine the nature of the sources. We find very likely Chandra

supernova remnant (SNR) and the latter as a SNR. In the group of 242 IGR

@article{citeulike:946615,
	abstract = {Motivation: The stochastic kinetics of a well-mixed chemical system, governed by the chemical Master equation, can be simulated using the exact methods of Gillespie. However, these methods do not scale well as systems become more complex and larger models are built to include reactions with widely varying rates, since the computational burden of simulation increases with the number of reaction events. Continuous models may provide an approximate solution and are computationally less costly, but they fail to capture the stochastic behavior of small populations of macromolecules.

Results: In this article we present a hybrid simulation algorithm that dynamically partitions the system into subsets of continuous and discrete reactions, approximates the continuous reactions deterministically as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and uses a Monte Carlo method for generating discrete reaction events according to a time-dependent propensity. Our approach to partitioning is improved such that we dynamically partition the system of reactions, based on a threshold relative to the distribution of propensities in the discrete subset. We have implemented the hybrid algorithm in an extensible framework, utilizing two rigorous ODE solvers to approximate the continuous reactions, and use an example model to illustrate the accuracy and potential speedup of the algorithm when compared with exact stochastic simulation.

above the superconducting transition temperature(Tc). The most enigmatic
property of the copper-oxide (cuprate) high temperature superconductor is the
so-called "pseudogap" phenomenon"-above Tc an energy gap remains. Moreover in
this unusual normal state, the pseudogap state, there are parts of the Fermi
surface that remain gapless.In the past twenty years, angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES) data suggest that the gapless portion of the Fermi
surface forms open ended arcs, rather than a closed loops, as an ordinary equal
energy contour should be. The existence of the Fermi arcs has puzzled the
physics community and triggered enormous research efforts. Here, by performing
ultra-high resolution ARPES measurements on high quality
Bi2(Sr2-xLax)CuO6+d(La-Bi2201) samples, we report the first direct evidence of
Fermi surface topology that is distinct from the Fermi arc picture. We find
that the ungapped portion of Fermi surface forms closed loops, i.e., the Fermi
pockets. In addition, our finding suggests that the carriers residing on this
Fermi pocket should be holes rather than electrons, and the Fermi pocket
exhibits unusual doping dependence. Together with the recent quantum
oscillation experiments done under high magnetic field, our observation of
Fermi pocket in zero field should shed new light on the mysterious pseudogap

Among the genes so activated are those that permit competence for genetic transformation. We have addressed the origin of bistability in expression of ComK. We show that bistability requires positive autoregulation at the promoter of comK, but not a potential toggle switch, in which ComK represses the promoter of rok and Rok represses the promoter of comK. We further address the source of the noise that results in the stochastic selection of cells that will express comK.

Despite four decades of research, a daunting number of unanswered questions about the mechanism of nitrogenase activity make it the  ” Everest of enzymes”. This Account describes our efforts to climb one  ” face” of this mountain by meeting two interdependent challenges central to determining the mechanism of biological N2 reduction. The first challenge is to determine the reaction pathway: the composition and structure of each of the substrate-derived moieties bound to the catalytic FeMo cofactor (FeMo-co) of the molybdenum−iron (MoFe) protein of nitrogenase. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to discriminate between the two classes of potential reaction pathways: (1) a  ” distal” (D) pathway, in which H atoms add sequentially at a single N or (2) an  ” alternating” (A) pathway, in which H atoms add alternately to the two N atoms of N2. Second, it is necessary to characterize the dynamics of conversion among intermediates within the accepted Lowe−Thorneley kinetic scheme for N2 reduction. That goal requires an experimental determination of the number of electrons and protons delivered to the MoFe protein as well as their  ” inventory”, a partition into those residing on each of the reaction components and released as H2 or NH3. The principal obstacle to this  ” climb” has been the inability to generate N2 reduction intermediates for characterization. A combination of genetic, biochemical, and spectroscopic approaches recently overcame this obstacle. These experiments identified one of the four-iron Fe−S faces of the active-site FeMo-co as the specific site of reactivity, indicated that the side chain of residue α70V controls access to this face, and supported the involvement of the side chain of residue α195H in proton delivery. We can now freeze-quench trap N2 reduction pathway intermediates and use electron−nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin−echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies to characterize them. However, even successful trapping of a N2 reduction intermediate occurs without synchronous electron delivery to the MoFe protein. As a result, the number of electrons and protons, n, delivered to MoFe during its formation is unknown. To determine n and the electron inventory, we initially employed ENDOR spectroscopy to analyze the substrate moiety bound to the FeMo-co and 57Fe within the cofactor. Difficulties in using that approach led us to devise a robust kinetic protocol for determining n of a trapped intermediate. This Account describes strategies that we have formulated to bring this  ” face” of the nitrogenase mechanism into view and afford approaches to its climb. Although the summit remains distant, we look forward to continued progress in the ascent.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Ubiquitous computing contains a huge promise for more intelligent services that are available anywhere and are able to dynamically adapt to the users' current context. However, what necessarily follows such an environment is the compromising of the users' privacy. We aim at analyzing this complex issue by applying and extending Altman's theoretical privacy framework, well known in social sciences, to privacy in ubicomp. Altman understands privacy as a two-way interactive process, which makes the approach promising in analyzing ubicomp where people, devices and the environment interact with each other. We point out similarities between the existing model and the features of ubicomp environment, and verify the results by applying and analyzing the resulting extended framework to typical ubicomp use cases. Based on the analysis, we argue that privacy in ubicomp can be modeled similarly to privacy in general by extending the model to cover such factors as mediation and non-human actors.},

Britain's cities. As Prime Minister Tony Blair declared (1998): "Over the last
two decades the gap between these worst estates and the rest of the country
has grown - it shames us as a nation, it wastes lives and we all have to pay
the costs of dependency and social division". This book documents and assesses
the core of New Labour's approach to the revitalisation of cities, that is,
the revival of citizenship, democratic renewal, and the participation of
communities to spear head urban change. In doing so, the book explores the
meaning, and relevance, of "community" as a focus for urban renaissance. It
interrogates the conceptual and ideological content of New Labour's
conceptions of community and, through the use of case studies, evaluates how
far, and with what effects, such conceptions are shaping contemporary urban
policy and practice. The book should be an important text for students and
researchers in geography, urban studies, planning, sociology, and related
disciplines. It will also be of interest to officers working in local and
central government, voluntary organisations, community groups, and those with
a stake in seeking to enhance democracy and community involvement in urban

@article{citeulike:4869409,
	abstract = {The Sp1 family of transcription factors are often involved in the regulated expression of TATA-less genes, frequently enhancing gene transcription. In this paper, we demonstrate that an Sp1-binding element inhibits the expression of the megakaryocyte-specific [alpha]IIb gene in all cell lines tested and that this inhibition is actively overcome only in megakaryocyte-like cell lines. We had noted previously in primary megakaryocytes that a 50-base pair (bp) deletion from [-]150 to [-]101 bp in the rat [alpha]IIb promoter region resulted in increased expression. We now show that deletion of this region markedly increased expression in both megakaryocytic and non-megakaryocytic cell lines, eliminating the tissue specificity of the [alpha]IIb promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) defined a single complex, which bound to a [-]145 to [-]125 bp subregion. Point mutations within this region, localized the critical point of binding around bases [-]136/[-]135, and expression studies showed that introduction of the [-]136/[-]135 mutation into the rat [alpha]IIb promoter had a comparable result to that seen with the 50-bp deletion. EMSA studies with the homologous human [alpha]IIb promoter region gave an identical migrating band. Southwestern blots of HeLa nuclear proteins with both the rat [-]145 to [-]125 DNA and its human homologue bound to a single \~{}110-kDa protein, the known molecular weight of Sp1. Confirmation that this region of the [alpha]IIb gene promoter bound Sp1 was accomplished using EMSA studies with an Sp1 consensus probe, anti-Sp1 and -Sp3 antibodies, and recombinant Sp1 protein. Further support for the role of Sp1 in the silencing of the [alpha]IIb promoter was obtained using a Gal4 binding site substitution for the silencer region of [alpha]IIb and co-expression of near full-length Sp1/Gal4 fusion protein expression vectors. Ectopic reinsertion of the [-]150 to [-]101 bp region, back into the [-]150 to [-]101 bp deleted promoter, enhanced rather than decreased expression, suggesting that Sp1's inhibitory role at [-]136/[-]135 depends on its local interactions. In summary, we believe that we have identified a cross-species, non-consensus Sp1-binding site that binds Sp1 and that acts as a silencer of [alpha]IIb expression in many cell lines. A model is presented as to how this Sp1-binding silencer element contributes to the megakaryocyte-specific expression of [alpha]IIb gene. 10.1074/jbc.273.10.5716},

	abstract = {The electronic structure of YBa2Cu3O6+x and La2-xSrxCuO4 for various values
of x has been investigated using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The
experimental results establish that the cleaving of YBa2Cu3O6+x compounds
occurs predominantly in the BaCuO3 complex leading to charged surfaces at
higher x and to uncharged surfaces at lower x values. The bulk component of the
core level spectra exhibits a shift in binding energy as a function of x, from
which a shift of the chemical potential as a function of hole concentration in
the CuO2 layers could be derived. The doping dependence of the chemical
potential across the transition from a Mott-Hubbard insulator to a
Fermi-liquid-like metal is very different in these two series of compounds. In
agreement with previous studies in the literature the chemical potential shift
in La2-xSrxCuO4 is close to zero for small hole concentrations. In YBa2Cu3O6+x,
similar to all other doped cuprates studied so far, a strong shift of the
chemical potential at low hole doping is detected. However, the results for the
inverse charge susceptibility at small x shows a large variation between
different doped cuprates. The results are discussed in view of various
theoretical models. None of these models turns out to be satisfactory.},

@book{citeulike:2941143,
	abstract = {Whether regarded as a science, an art, or a skill–and it can properly be
regarded as all three–logic is the basis of our ability to think, analyze,
argue, and communicate. Indeed, logic goes to the very core of what we mean by
human intelligence. In this concise, crisply readable book, distinguished
professor D. Q. McInerny offers an indispensable guide to using logic to
advantage in everyday life. Written explicitly for the layperson, McInerny's
\_Being Logical\_ promises to take its place beside Strunk and White's \_The
Elements of Style\_ as a classic of lucid, invaluable advice.


As McInerny notes, logic is a deep, wide, and wonderfully varied field, with a
bearing on every aspect of our intellectual life. A mastery of logic begins
with an understanding of right reasoning–and encompasses a grasp of the close
kinship between logical thought and logical expression, a knowledge of the
basic terms of argument, and a familiarity with the pitfalls of illogical
thinking. Accordingly, McInerny structures his book in a series of brief,
penetrating chapters that build on one another to form a unified and coherent
introduction to clear and effective reasoning.


At the heart of the book is a brilliant consideration of argument–how an
argument is founded and elaborated, how it differs from other forms of
intellectual discourse, and how it critically embodies the elements of logic.
McInerny teases out the subtleties and complexities of premises and
conclusions, differentiates statements of fact from statements of value, and
discusses the principles and uses of every major type of argument, from the
syllogistic to the conditional. In addition, he provides an incisive look at
illogical thinking and explains how to recognize and avoid the most common
errors of logic.


Elegant, pithy, and precise, \_Being Logical\_ breaks logic down to its
essentials through clear analysis, accessible examples, and focused insights.
Whether you are a student or a teacher, a professional sharpening your career
skills or an amateur devoted to the fine points of thought and expression, you
are sure to find this brief guide to effecting reasoning both fascinating and
illuminating.

This suggests that there still remain substantial challenges for research in IR. Already in 1988, on the occasion of receiving the ACM SIGIR Gerard Salton Award, Karen Sp\"{a}rck Jones suggested that substantial progress in information retrieval was likely only to come through addressing issues associated with users (actual or potential) of IR systems, rather than continuing IR research's almost exclusive focus on document representation and matching and ranking techniques. In recent years it appears that her message has begun to be heard, yet we still have relatively few substantive results that respond to it. In this talk, I identify a few challenges for IR research which fall within the scope of association with users, and which I believe, if properly addressed, are likely to lead to substantial increases in the usefulness, usability and pleasurability of information retrieval.},

Because generators face nonconvex costs, in particular startup costs and minimum run levels, the exchanges allow  ” block orders” that are all-or-nothing orders of a given amount of electric energy in multiple consecutive hours, while the standard order consists of an amount for a single hour that can be curtailed. All exchanges restrict the size (MWh/h), the type (span in terms of hours) or the number (per participant per day) of blocks that can be introduced.

coupled to the \$(\pi,\pi)\$ magnetic resonance, the sharp structure at \$70 \$meV

	abstract = {Bacterial group IIC introns are a subclass of group II intron ribozymes that are typically located downstream from transcriptional terminators. Class IIC-attC introns constitute a monophyletic subset of subgroup IIC, which preferentially insert into site-specific recombination sequences for integron integrases (attC). attCs are a diverse family of nucleotide sequences composed of conserved inverted repeats that flank a variable, but palindromic, central region. In this study, we used both PCR and colony patch hybridization methods to determine the basis for recognition of the attC(aadA1) stem-loop motif by the Serratia marcescens intron (S.ma.I2) in vivo. The quantitative results showed that mobility into the wild-type site occurs at a frequency of 18\%, and is strongly biased by the orientation of the homing site relative to the direction of DNA replication. S.ma.I2 mobility results into mutant attC(aadA1) sites are consistent with recognition of stem-loop motifs in unwound DNA. The homing frequency results showed that, while the entire attC sequence is not necessary for recognition of the insertion site, short deletions of the attC stem-loop motif inhibited the intron mobility. Moreover, our data show that S.ma.I2 requires a bulged base in the folded attC stem for high homing frequency. We demonstrate that the IBS1/IBS3 motifs and two bulge bases conserved among attCs determine S.ma.I2 homing specificity for the attC bottom strand. These results suggest that class IIC-attC introns tolerate attC variation by recognition of a bulged hairpin DNA motif rather than a specific sequence.},

hand, the minimum amount of local noise necessary to induce separability on
states arising from N Bose symmetric extensions with Positive Partial Transpose
(PPT) decreases at least as fast as O(1/N^2). From these results, we derive
upper bounds on the time and space complexity of the weak membership problem of
separability when attacked via algorithms that search for PPT symmetric
extensions. Finally, we show how to estimate the error we incur when we
approximate the set of separable states by the set of (PPT) N -extendable
quantum states in order to compute the maximum average fidelity in pure state
estimation problems, the maximal output purity of quantum channels, and the
geometric measure of entanglement.},

A single IGLC gene and eight different potential IGLV genes belonging to four different families were detected. The axolotl Cgamma domain has several residues or stretches of residues that are typically conserved in mammalian, avian, and Xenopus Cgamma, but the KATLVCL stretch, which is well conserved in the Cgamma and T-cell receptor Cbeta domains of many vertebrate species, is not well conserved. All axolotl Vgamma sequences closely match several human and Xenopus Vgamma-like sequences and, although the axolotl Cgamma and Vgamma sequences are very like their tetrapod homologues, they are not closely related to nontetrapod L chains. Southern blot experiments suggested the presence of a single IGLC gene and of a limited number of IGLV genes, and analysis of IGLV-J junctions clearly indicated that at least three of the IGLJ segments can associate with IGLV1, IGLV2, or IGLV3 subgroup genes. The overall diversity of the axolotl Vgamma CDR3 junctions seems to be of the same order as that of mammalian Vgamma chains. However, a single IGLV4 segment was found among the 45 cDNAs analyzed. This suggests that the axolotl IGL locus may have a canonical tandem structure, like the mammalian IGK or IGH loci. Immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and microsequencing experiments strongly suggested that most, if not all L chains are of the gamma type. This may explain in part the poor humoral response of the axolotl.},

	abstract = {Based on presently available genome data, we characterized the genomic organization of all three light chain gene (rho, sigma and type III) loci in Xenopus tropicalis. The rho gene locus in X. tropicalis, structurally similar to the kappa gene loci in mammals, was shown to contain a single C rho gene and nine J rho segments. The sigma locus also contains a single C gene, although two distinct C sigma genes have previously been found in Xenopus laevis (most likely due to chromosome polyploidy). Four J sigma gene segments were identified upstream of the C sigma. The type III light chain gene locus, spanning approximately 170 kb DNA, structurally resembles the topology of mammalian lambda gene loci, containing three C genes (C III 1-3). C III 2 and C III 3 are both preceded by single, unique, J genes, whereas C III 1 contains three J gene segments. Furthermore, two additional J gene segments, termed J III x1 and J III x2, were found in the intron separating V III 2 and pV III 1 (a pseudogene). Based on BLAST searches against the X. tropicalis EST database, all the C genes identified in this study were shown to be functional. On the basis of similarity of protein sequences, genomic organization and chromosomal location of the light chain genes among frogs and mammals, our data strongly support the previous suggestions that the rho genes belong to the kappa gene lineage, whereas the type III genes share a common origin with the lambda genes.},

Phylogenetic comparisons have established orthology between this new shark L chain and the unique Xenopus L chain isotype sigma. More importantly, inclusion of this new L chain family in phylogenetic analyses showed that all vertebrate L chains can be categorized into four ancestral clans originating prior to the emergence of cartilaginous fish: one restricted to elasmobranchs (sigma-cart/type I), one found in all cold-blooded vertebrates (sigma/teleost type 2/elasmobranch type IV), one in all groups except bony fish (lambda/elasmobranch type II), and one in all groups except birds (kappa/elasmobranch type III/teleost type 1 and 3). All four of these primordial L chain isotypes (sigma, sigma-cart, lambda and kappa) have maintained separate V region identities since their emergence at least 450 million years ago, suggestive of an ancient physiological distinction of the L chains. We suggest that, based upon unique, discrete sizes of complementarity determining regions 1 and 2 and other features of the V region sequences, the different L chain isotypes arose to provide different functional conformations in the Ig binding site when they pair with heavy chains.},

@article{citeulike:4729708,
	abstract = {The accuracy of the system model in an iterative reconstruction algorithm greatly affects the quality of reconstructed positron emission tomography (PET) images. For efficient computation in reconstruction, the system model in PET can be factored into a product of a geometric projection matrix and sinogram blurring matrix, where the former is often computed based on analytical calculation, and the latter is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. Direct measurement of a sinogram blurring matrix is difficult in practice because of the requirement of a collimated source. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the 2D blurring kernels from uncollimated point source measurements. Since the resulting sinogram blurring matrix stems from actual measurements, it can take into account the physical effects in the photon detection process that are difficult or impossible to model in a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and hence provide a more accurate system model. Another advantage of the proposed method over MC simulation is that it can easily be applied to data that have undergone a transformation to reduce the data size (e.g., Fourier rebinning). Point source measurements were acquired with high count statistics in a relatively fine grid inside the microPET II scanner using a high-precision 2D motion stage. A monotonically convergent iterative algorithm has been derived to estimate the detector blurring matrix from the point source measurements. The algorithm takes advantage of the rotational symmetry of the PET scanner and explicitly models the detector block structure. The resulting sinogram blurring matrix is incorporated into a maximum a posteriori (MAP) image reconstruction algorithm. The proposed method has been validated using a 3 x 3 line phantom, an ultra-micro resolution phantom and a 22Na point source superimposed on a warm background. The results of the proposed method show improvements in both resolution and contrast ratio when compared with the MAP reconstruction with a MC-based sinogram blurring matrix, and one without a detector response model. The reconstruction time is unaffected by the new method since the blurring component takes a relatively small part of the overall reconstruction time. The proposed method can be applied to other PET scanners for human and animal imaging.},

Tissue and serum samples were evaluated for the presence of virus using qPCR analysis and were assessed for vector-related tissue or laboratory effects.RESULTS: Levels of Ad5.SSTR/TK.RGD in blood and tissues outside of the abdominal cavity were low, indicating minimal systemic absorption. GCV did not affect Ad5.SSTR/TK.RGD biodistribution. The mean Ad5.SSTR/TK.RGD viral level was 100-fold lower on day 19 than day 4, suggesting vector elimination over time. Animals in the Ad5.SSTR/TK.RGD +/- GCV cohort had clinical laboratory parameters and microscopic lesions in the abdominal organs indicative of an inflammatory response. Toxicity in this dose cohort seemed to be reversible over time.CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide justification for planned dosing of Ad5.SSTR/TK.RGD for a planned phase I clinical trial and insights regarding anticipated toxicity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:: The TRPA1 ion channel modulates excitability of nociceptors, and it may be activated by compounds resulting from oxidative insults. Diabetes mellitus produces oxidative stress and sensory neuropathy. The authors tested the hypothesis that diabetes-induced endogenous compounds acting on the TRPA1 ion channel contribute to development and maintenance of mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS:: Diabetes mellitus was induced by streptozotocin. Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed by the monofilament and paw pressure tests. Chembridge-5861528 (CHEM; a TRPA1 channel antagonist, a derivative of HC-030031) or vehicle was administered acutely or twice daily for 10 days in diabetic animals. For comparison, effects of CHEM were assessed in a group of healthy control animals. RESULTS:: Acute administration of CHEM attenuated mechanically induced withdrawal responses in diabetic and control groups. The maximal effect (over 50\% elevation of the paw pressure threshold) by acute administration of CHEM was obtained in 30 min. The lowest dose producing a significant attenuation was 10 mg/kg in the diabetic group and 30 mg/kg in the healthy controls. Chronic administration of CHEM (30 mg/kg twice daily) for a week in the diabetic group attenuated development of mechanical hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS:: Reduction of pain-related behavior by a lower dose of the TRPA1 channel antagonist in the diabetic than in the control group suggests that endogenous compounds resulting from diabetes mellitus and acting on the TRPA1 channel contribute to diabetic hypersensitivity. Prolonged antihypersensitivity effect after chronic treatment suggests that daily administration of a TRPA1 channel antagonist may prevent development of diabetic hypersensitivity.},

	abstract = {An approach is described for joint interleaved recording, real-time processing, and analysis of NMR data sets. The method employs multidimensional decomposition to find common information in a set of conventional triple-resonance spectra recorded in the nonlinear sampling mode, and builds a model of hyperdimensional (HD) spectrum. While preserving sensitivity per unit of measurement time and allowing for maximal spectral resolution, the approach reduces data collection time on average by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the conventional method. The 7-10 dimensional HD spectrum, which is represented as a set of deconvoluted 1D vectors, is easy to handle and amenable for automated analysis. The method is exemplified by automated assignment for two protein systems of low and high spectral complexity: ubiquitin (globular, 8 kDa) and zetacyt (naturally disordered, 13 kDa). The collection and backbone assignment of the data sets are achieved in real time after approximately 1 and 10 h, respectively. The approach removes the most critical time bottlenecks in data acquisition and analysis. Thus, it can significantly increase the value of NMR spectroscopy in structural biology, for example, in high-throughput structural genomics applications.},

	abstract = {We present a general formalism to make the Replica-Symmetric and
Replica-Symmetry-Breaking ansatz in the context of Kikuchi's Cluster
Variational Method (CVM). Using replicas and the message-passing formulation of
CVM we obtain a variational expression of the replicated free energy of a
system with quenched disorder, both averaged and on a single sample, and make
the hierarchical ansatz using functionals of functions of fields to represent
the messages.


We begin to study the method considering the plaquette approximation to the
averaged free energy of the Edwards-Anderson model in the paramagnetic
Replica-Symmetric phase. In two dimensions we find that the spurious spin-glass
phase transition of the Bethe approximation disappears and the paramagnetic
phase is stable down to zero temperature in all the three regular 2D lattices.
The quantitative estimates of the free energy and of various other quantities
improve those of the Bethe approximation. We provide the physical
interpretation of the beliefs in the replica-symmetric phase as disorder
distributions of the local Hamiltonians. The messages instead do not admit such
an interpretation and indeed they cannot be represented as populations in the
spin-glass phase at variance with the Bethe approximation.},

@article{citeulike:4680675,
	abstract = {Transfection of small RNAs (such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)) into cells typically lowers expression of many genes. Unexpectedly, increased expression of genes also occurs. We investigated whether this upregulation results from a saturation effect-that is, competition among the transfected small RNAs and the endogenous pool of miRNAs for the intracellular machinery that processes small RNAs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genome-wide transcript responses from 151 published transfection experiments in seven different human cell types. We show that targets of endogenous miRNAs are expressed at significantly higher levels after transfection, consistent with impaired effectiveness of endogenous miRNA repression. This effect exhibited concentration and temporal dependence. Notably, the profile of endogenous miRNAs can be largely inferred by correlating miRNA sites with gene expression changes after transfections. The competition and saturation effects have practical implications for miRNA target prediction, the design of siRNA and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) genomic screens and siRNA therapeutics.},

UV radiation is one of the most important physical parameters which influences yeast growth in nature. Here we used 46 natural strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> isolated from several natural populations at the  ” Evolution Canyon” microsite (Nahal Oren, Mt. Carmel, Israel). The opposing slopes of this canyon share the same geology, soil, and macroclimate, but they differ in microclimatic conditions. The interslope differences in solar radiation (200\%–800\% more on the  ” African” slope) caused the development of two distinct biomes. The south-facing slope is sunnier and has xeric, savannoid  ” African” environment while the north-facing slope is represented by temperate,  ” European” forested environment. Here we studied the phenotypic response of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains to UVA and UVC radiations and to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in order to evaluate the interslope effect on the strains' ability to withstand DNA-damaging agents.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title> <p>We exposed our strains to the different DNA-damaging agents and measured survival by counting colony forming units. The strains from the  ” African” slope were more resilient to both UVA and MMS than the strains from the  ” European” slope. In contrast, we found that there was almost no difference between strains (with similar ploidy) from the opposite slopes, in their sensitivity to UVC radiation. These results suggest that the  ” African” strains are more adapted to higher solar radiation than the  ” European” strains. We also found that the tetraploids strains were more tolerant to all DNA-damaging agents than their neighboring diploid strains, which suggest that high ploidy level might be a mechanism of adaptation to high solar radiation.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Conclusions/Significance</title> <p>Our results and the results of parallel studies with several other organisms, suggest that natural selection appears to select, at a microscale, for adaptive complexes that can tolerate the higher UV radiation on the  ” African” slope.</p> </sec>},

@article{citeulike:4860661,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The structural analysis of protein ligand binding sites can provide information relevant for assigning functions to unknown proteins, to guide the drug discovery process and to infer relations among distant protein folds. Previous approaches to the comparative analysis of binding pockets have usually been focused either on the ligand or the protein component. Even though several useful observations have been made with these approaches they both have limitations. In the former case the analysis is restricted to binding pockets interacting with similar ligands, while in the latter it is difficult to systematically check whether the observed structural similarities have a functional significance. RESULTS:Here we propose a novel methodology that takes into account the structure of both the binding pocket and the ligand. We first look for local similarities in a set of binding pockets and then check whether the bound ligands, even if completely different, share a common fragment that can account for the presence of the structural motif. Thanks to this method we can identify structural motifs whose functional significance is explained by the presence of shared features in the interacting ligands. CONCLUSIONS:The application of this method to a large dataset of binding pockets allows the identification of recurring protein motifs that bind specific ligand fragments, even in the context of molecules with a different overall structure. In addition some of these motifs are present in a high number of evolutionarily unrelated proteins.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent years have seen an increased amount of natural language processing (NLP) work on full text biomedical journal publications. Much of this work is done with Open Access journal articles. Such work assumes that Open Access articles are representative of biomedical publications in general and that methods developed for analysis of Open Access full text publications will generalize to the biomedical literature as a whole. If this assumption is wrong, the cost to the community will be large, including not just wasted resources, but also flawed science. This paper examines that assumption.RESULTS:We collected two sets of documents, one consisting only of Open Access publications and the other consisting only of traditional journal publications. We examined them for differences in surface linguistic structures that have obvious consequences for the ease or difficulty of natural language processing and for differences in semantic content as reflected in lexical items. Regarding surface linguistic structures, we examined the incidence of conjunctions, negation, passives, and pronominal anaphora, and found that the two collections did not differ. We also examined the distribution of sentence lengths and found that both collections were characterized by the same mode. Regarding lexical items, we found that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two collections was low, and was lower than the divergence between either collection and a reference corpus. Where small differences did exist, log likelihood analysis showed that they were primarily in the area of formatting and in specific named entities.CONCLUSIONS:We did not find structural or semantic differences between the Open Access and traditional journal collections. Research on Open Access full-text articles should generalize to the biomedical literature as a whole.},

The essay goes on to show the role of such a hermeneutic in revising our narratives of the history of geographical thought by looking at the print format of British geography books in the era 1500-1900. It is argued that the age of discovery created a `problem situation' for geographical knowledge which was solved by the geographical grammar, this solution only collapsing with the closing of the world in the late-nineteenth century. It is further shown that the so-called `new' geography of the late-nineteenth century developed a radically different print space for geography. The print spaces of early modern and new geography are shown to have been key determinants of the social and intellectual positioning of geography as a scholarly enterprise.},

	abstract = {Molecular studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have identified susceptibility genes for the categorically diagnosed disorder using operational diagnostic criteria. Here, we take a QTL approach to mapping genes for ADHD using a composite continuous index of ADHD behavior in a large epidemiological sample. Previous studies of clinical ADHD suggest that two functional polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), one in the 5'-regulatory region of the gene (5-HTTLPR) and the other a VNTR (5-HTTVNTR) in the second intron, as well as a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR SNP), may be associated with the disorder. Here, we investigate these polymorphisms as well as an additional ten SNPs spread across the gene. We found significant association with the long (L) allele of the 5-HTTLPR; P = 0.019, but neither the 5-HTTVNTR nor the 3'-UTR SNP were significantly associated. Significant associations (P < 0.05) were found for a further 5 the 10 other markers tested. We found evidence for two haplotype blocks spanning the region. We found strong evidence for association with the first haplotype block (comprised of four markers), with the significance of a combined primary and secondary test of association reaching an empirical P value = 0.0054 for the global test and an empirical P value = 0.00081 for the largest local test. Thus, we show here that SLC6A4, which has a major influence on brain serotonin availability, may be a QTL for ADHD.},

Closely reading advertising images, the article examines how the Armour Packing Company placed their chicken tamale in relation to imaginative geographies of Mexico from this era. Through tracing the symbolic transformations of the tamale from its existence in the street life of the late 19th century US to the nation-wide advertising campaign initiated by the Armour Packing Company in 1898, this article will highlight some of the shifting meanings of the tamale as seen in American travel literature, novels, and popular magazines of the time. That the marketing and symbolic transformation of the tamale in advertising coincide with the escalation and development of the Spanish-American War, American imperialism, and changing notions of race and place in this era has particular implication for the geographies of knowledge associated with ethnic foods and has wider import for the construction of race, identity, and difference at the close of 19th century. 10.1177/1474474008094316},

communication scenario: One sender wants to send classical or quantum
information through a noisy quantum channel to one receiver with zero
probability of error. First we show that there are quantum channels of which a
single use is not able to transmit classical information perfectly yet two uses
can. This is achieved by employing entangled input states between different
uses of the given channel and thus cannot happen for classical channels. Second
we exhibit a class of quantum channel with vanishing zero-error classical
capacity such that when a noiseless qubit channel or one ebit shared
entanglement are available, it can be used to transmit \$\log\_2 d\$ noiseless
qubits, where 2d is the dimension of input state space. Third we further
construct quantum channels with vanishing zero-error classical capacity when
assisted with classical feedback can be used to transmit both classical and
quantum information perfectly. These striking findings not only indicate both
the zero-error quantum and classical capacities of quantum channels satisfy a
strong super-additivity beyond any classical channels, but also highlight the
activation power of auxiliary physical resources in zero-error communication.},

Then, after centuries of relatively little activity, scientific interest grew during the 17th century and social concerns were again voiced during the 19th century. Many of the wave-propagation mechanisms relevant outdoors were understood at least qualitatively by the late 1800s. Today, knowledge of sound propagation phenomena is of great economic and social importance because of environmental and other concerns. Reality is more complicated than geometrical spreading above flat ground. Some grounds are acoustically hard like concrete, and others soft as snow. Corresponding reflection coefficients are complex and vary with angle. Grounds may not be flat, leading to shadow zones or alternatively multiple reflections at the ground. Gradients of wind or temperature refract waves either upwards (upwind or in a temperature lapse) or downwards (downwind or in a temperature inversion). Atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations in the acoustical effects. Many of these features mutually interact. Measured sound pressure levels owe as much to near-surface weather and to ground shape and impedance as to acoustical factors such as source and receiver heights and their separation. This tutorial paper emphasizes field measurements and simple physical interpretations.},

It is a daunting task to balance the generation of new molecules with limitations on growth that produce desired features such as stability in water, synthetic accessibility, or druglikeness. We have developed an algorithm, Fragment Optimized Growth (FOG), which statistically biases the growth of molecules with desired features. At the heart of the algorithm is a Markov Chain which adds fragments to the nascent molecule in a biased manner, depending on the frequency of specific fragment-fragment connections in the database of chemicals it was trained on. We show that in addition to generating synthetically feasible molecules, it can be trained to grow new molecules that resemble desired classes of molecules such as drugs, natural products, and diversity-oriented synthetic products. In order to classify our grown molecules, we developed the Topology Classifier (TopClass) algorithm that is capable of classifying compounds, for example as drugs or nondrugs. The classification accuracies obtained with TopClass compare favorably with the literature. Furthermore, in contrast to  ” black-box” approaches such as Neural Networks, TopClass brings to light characteristics of drugs that distinguish them from nondrugs.},

As part of a global discipline, nurses are vitally interested in reducing and eliminating disparities so that better health is achieved for all people. Recent literature in nursing encourages our discipline to engage  more actively with social justice issues. Justice in health care is a major commitment of nursing; thus questions in the larger sphere of globalization, justice   and ethics, are our discipline's questions also. Global justice, or fairness, is not an issue for some groups or institutions, but a deeper human rights issue that is a responsibility for everyone. What can we do to help reduce or eliminate the social   and economic disparities that are so evident? What kind of ethical milieu is needed to address the threat that globalization imposes on justice and fairness?

The portion of peptidoglycan not linked to teichoic acid (60-75\% of the whole) was degraded with Chalaropsis muramidase to yield disaccharide-peptide monomers and dimers, trimers and oligomers formed by biosynthetic cross-linking of the monomers. The degree of O-acetylation of these fragments was also examined. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the proportion of label initially in the monomer fraction immediately after the 1 min pulse declined rapidly during a 3 min chase, while the oligomer fraction (fragments greater than trimer) gained the radioactivity proportionately. The radioactivity of the dimer and trimer fractions remained virtually unchanged. At 4 min after the commencement of labelling (i.e. approx. one-tenth of a generation time) final values had been reached. The O-acetylation of all fragments had achieved final values even at 1 min, except for the monomer fraction, which showed an increase from 40\% to 60\% during the first 3 min of chase. Although O-acetylation was clearly a very rapid process, no O-acetylated peptidoglycan lipid-intermediates could be detected. 10.1099/00221287-135-11-3015},

@article{citeulike:4868166,
	abstract = {While there is an increasing recognition of the social character of knowledge in segments of the literature on knowledge management, this paper argues that there has been a limited engagement with issues surrounding the politics of knowledge. There is now a well-established critique of technically-led knowledge management practices in which knowledge is treated in passive, objectivised, and static terms. A key element of this critique concerns the limits of codification strategies directed at making tacit knowledge explicit. This is founded upon an interpretative conceptualisation of inter-subjective understanding as always provisional, incomplete, and embedded in contexts of social action. While sympathetic to this position, it is argued that there is more to considering knowledge practices than the problem of understanding. Shared understanding, where participants to an interaction achieve a satisfactory interpretation of their respective positions, in no way implies mutual agreement about the validity of these positions. Drawing on insights from Habermas about models of social action and knowledge-guiding interests, we offer a series of concepts encouraging sensitivity to the relationship between knowledge, power, and interests. Aspects of the argument are then illustrated with case examples drawn from research into organisational knowledge in companies producing and using complex products and systems.

@article{CorradaBravo2009,
	abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0902906106 We present a method for examining the relative influence of familial, genetic, and environmental covariate information in flexible nonparametric risk models. Our goal is investigating the relative importance of these three sources of information as they are associated with a particular outcome. To that end, we developed a method for incorporating arbitrary pedigree information in a smoothing spline ANOVA (SS-ANOVA) model. By expressing pedigree data as a positive semidefinite kernel matrix, the SS-ANOVA model is able to estimate a log-odds ratio as a multicomponent function of several variables: one or more functional components representing information from environmental covariates and/or genetic marker data and another representing pedigree relationships. We report a case study on models for retinal pigmentary abnormalities in the Beaver Dam Eye Study. Our model verifies known facts about the epidemiology of this eye lesion—found in eyes with early age-related macular degeneration—and shows significantly increased predictive ability in models that include all three of the genetic, environmental, and familial data sources. The case study also shows that models that contain only two of these data sources, that is, pedigree-environmental covariates, or pedigree-genetic markers, or environmental covariates-genetic markers, have comparable predictive ability, but less than the model with all three. This result is consistent with the notions that genetic marker data encode—at least in part—pedigree data, and that familial correlations encode shared environment data as well.},

The incidence of  BRCA gene mutation is very high in Ashkenazi Jewish women of European descent, and many issues can arise, particularly for observant Orthodox women, because of their genetic status.

In this article the moral direction that Jewish law gives   to women regarding testing, confidentiality, and other issues is explored.

@article{citeulike:4867981,
	abstract = {Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity such as salt depletion is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70\%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40\%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; >30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (>0.5\% in 70\% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (>600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.},

	abstract = {Sp1, Sp3 (SPR-2) and Sp4 (SPR-1) are human sequence-specific DNA binding proteins with very similar structural features. In this report, we have analyzed Sp3 in direct comparison with Sp1. We have raised antibodies against both Sp1 and Sp3, and show that Sp3 protein, like Sp1, is expressed in various cell lines. Co-transfection experiments in different mammalian cell lines reveal that in contrast to Sp1 and Sp4, Sp3 is not able to activate several Sp1 responsive promoters. In addition, Sp3 also fails to activate reporter constructs in Drosophila SL2 cells lacking endogenous Sp factors. Instead, we find that Sp3 represses Sp1-mediated activation in a linear dose-dependent manner. A mutant of Sp3 lacking the DNA binding domain does not affect activation by Sp1, suggesting that the inhibition is most likely due to the competition with Sp1 for their common binding sites. To determine if any structurally similar domain of Sp3 is able to replace partially homologous domains of Sp1, we have generated chimeric proteins and tested their activation characteristics in gene transfer experiments. It appears that neither the glutamine-rich domains A and B nor the D domain of Sp1 can be replaced by the homologous regions of Sp3. Our results suggest that Sp3 is an inhibitory member of the Sp family.},

It is then assumed that each regression curve mj is a linear combination of a small number L ≪ N of common functions g1, ..., gLk. For example, if all mj's are straight lines, this holds with \$L = 2, g\_1 \equiv 1\$ and g2(x) = x. In this paper the assumption of a prespecified model is dropped. A nonparametric method is presented which allows estimation of the smallest L and corresponding functions g1, ..., gL from the data. The procedure combines smoothing techniques with ideas related to principal component analysis. An asymptotic theory is presented with yields detailed insight into properties of the resulting estimators. An application to household expenditure data illustrates the approach.},

Mammalian cells are cultured on a glass slide printed in defined locations with different DNAs. Cells growing on the printed areas take up the DNA, creating spots of localized transfection within a lawn of non-transfected cells. By printing sets of complementary DNAs cloned in expression vectors, we make microarrays whose features are clusters of live cells that express a defined cDNA at each location. Here we demonstrate two uses for our approach: as an alternative to protein microarrays for the identification of drug targets, and as an expression cloning system for the discovery of gene products that alter cellular physiology. By screening transfected cell microarrays expressing 192 different cDNAs, we identified proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signalling, apoptosis and cell adhesion, and with distinct subcellular distributions.},

A critical and time-consuming part of business process development is the detection and handling of exceptions that may occur during process execution. In this paper, we introduce a novel, policy-driven approach to exception management, which substantially simplifies business process development. We advocate that exception management should be implemented in the system infrastructure. Using our exception management framework, developers define exception policies in a declarative manner. Before a business process is executed, the service composition middleware integrates the exception policies with normal business logic to generate an exception-aware process schema. We argue that our policy-driven approach significantly reduces the development time of business processes through its separation of the development of the business logic and the exception handling policies.},

We suggest a variant on the usual form of cross-validation for choosing the degree of smoothing to be employed. This method of cross-validation, which consists of deleting entire sample curves, has the advantage that it does not require that the covariance structure be known or estimated. In the estimation of the covariance structure, we are primarily concerned with models in which the first few eigenfunctions are smooth and the eigenvalues decay rapidly, so that the variability is predominantly of large scale. We propose smooth nonparametric estimates of the eigen-functions and a suitable method of cross-validation to determine the amount of smoothing.

	abstract = {Background
There is growing interest in the relation between the brain and music. The appealing similarity between brainwaves and the rhythms of music has motivated many scientists to seek a connection between them. A variety of transferring rules has been utilized to convert the brainwaves into music; and most of them are mainly based on spectra feature of EEG.

Methodology/Principal Findings
In this study, audibly recognizable scale-free music was deduced from individual Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms. The translation rules include the direct mapping from the period of an EEG waveform to the duration of a note, the logarithmic mapping of the change of average power of EEG to music intensity according to the Fechner's law, and a scale-free based mapping from the amplitude of EEG to music pitch according to the power law. To show the actual effect, we applied the deduced sonification rules to EEG segments recorded during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS). The resulting music is vivid and different between the two mental states; the melody during REM sleep sounds fast and lively, whereas that in SWS sleep is slow and tranquil. 60 volunteers evaluated 25 music pieces, 10 from REM, 10 from SWS and 5 from white noise (WN), 74.3\% experienced a happy emotion from REM and felt boring and drowsy when listening to SWS, and the average accuracy for all the music pieces identification is 86.8\%(κ = 0.800, P<0.001). We also applied the method to the EEG data from eyes closed, eyes open and epileptic EEG, and the results showed these mental states can be identified by listeners.

Conclusions/Significance
The sonification rules may identify the mental states of the brain, which provide a real-time strategy for monitoring brain activities and are potentially useful to neurofeedback therapy.},

While exploiting their possible support for fault tolerance (e.g., transactional support at the level of each service), the proposed solution has no impact on the autonomy of the individual Web services, our solution lies in system structuring in terms of co-operative atomic actions that have a well-defined behavior, both in the absence and in the presence of service failures. More specifically, we define the notion of Web Service Composition Action (WSCA), based on the Coordinated Atomic Action concept, which allows structuring composite Web services in terms of dependable actions. Fault tolerance can then be obtained as an emergent property of the aggregation of several potentially non-dependable services. We further introduce a framework enabling the development of composite Web services based on WSCAs, consisting of an XML-based language for the specification of WSCAs.},

other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field.
In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules
coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a
general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized
by a spectral Chern number \$\nu\$. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the
original model correspond to \$\nu=0\$ and \$\nu=\pm 1\$, respectively. The anyonic
properties of excitation depend on \$\nu\bmod 16\$, whereas \$\nu\$ itself governs
edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on
anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal

	abstract = {There was considerable heterogeneity of the biochemical, clinical and immunological findings in 12 patients and two fetuses from 16 kindreds affected by severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to a complete deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). Despite this heterogeneity a consistent pattern was observed, in which levels of abnormal purine metabolites paralleled the severity of the immunodeficiency. A high level of urinary deoxyadenosine was a universal finding for homozygous ADA deficiency. ATP depletion, in association with raised deoxy-ATP (dATP) levels, was found in the erythrocytes of nine infants with profound cellular and humoral immunodeficiency. There was no erythrocyte ATP depletion in two patients with some residual immunity, who presented later, but adenosine accumulated in their plasma and urine. This finding, together with the presence of some T and normal B-lymphocytes in less severely affected patients, suggests that adenosine is relatively non-toxic. The other results are consistent with the hypothesis that the sequence of deoxyadenosine accumulation, dATP formation and ATP depletion represents the major mechanism of toxicity to the immune system. Low numbers of T lymphocytes and dATP accumulation were also found in the blood of affected fetuses at 18 weeks gestation. Since extreme instability of erythrocyte ADA was demonstrated in some heterozygotes, and heterozygote ADA levels were detected in one infant with SCID, simultaneous immunological and biochemical analysis of fetal blood are important for precise antenatal diagnosis.},

We propose to use the concept of conversational floor as a means to synchronize the internal state of the dialogue manager with the real world. To act as the interface between these two layers, we introduce a new component, called the Interaction Manager. The proposed architecture was implemented as a new version of the Olympus framework, which can be used across different domains and modalities. We confirmed the practicality of the approach by porting Let's Go, an existing deployed dialogue system to the new architecture.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Metabolic acid-base disorders are common in critically ill patients. Clinicians may have difficulty recognizing their presence when multiple metabolic acid-base derangements are present in a single patient. Clinicians should be able to identify the components of complex metabolic acid-base disorders since metabolic acidoses due to unmeasured anions are associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. This review presents the derivation of three commonly used methods of acid-base analysis, which include the anion gap, Stewart physiochemical, and modified base excess. Clinical examples are also provided to demonstrate the subtleties of the different methods and to demonstrate their application to real patient data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comparison of these methods shows that each one is equally adept at identifying a metabolic acidosis due to unmeasured anions; however, the Stewart physiochemical and the modified base excess methods better evaluate complex metabolic acid-base disorders. CONCLUSIONS: While all three methods correctly identify metabolic acidosis due to unmeasured anions, which is a predictor of mortality, it remains unclear if further delineation of complex metabolic acid-base disorders using the Stewart physiochemical or the modified base excess methods is clinically beneficial.},

This approach, however, has been criticized by some as (1) qualitative and not quantitative in nature and (2) incapable of detecting important diagnoses. Stewart, using principals of electroneutrality and conservation of mass, developed a "new" approach to the diagnosis and management of these disorders. The proponents of Stewart's approach believe that it not only offers a mechanistic explanation for the disorders but also provides the tool to make a more accurate diagnosis. Although Stewart's approach has been largely ignored by nephrologists and renal physiologists, it is increasingly used by anesthesiologists and intensivists. This review discusses the clinical utility of Stewart's method compared with the traditional bicarbonate-based approach. Although Stewart's method proposes a different, however not new, approach, it does not improve our ability to diagnose more accurately or manage these disorders. Stewart's method also does not provide the tool to prognosticate any better than the traditional method.},

In this research, 56 participants each engaged in six e-commerce Web searching tasks. We mined these tasks from the transaction log of a major Web search engine, so the tasks represent real e-commerce searching information needs. Using 60 organic and 30 sponsored Web links retrieved by submitting these queries to the Google search engine, we controlled the quality of the Web search engine listings by switching non-sponsored and sponsored links on half of the tasks for each participant. This approach allowed for both investigating the bias toward sponsored links while controlling for quality of content. Data included 2453 interactions with result page links, 961 utterances evaluating these links, and 102 results from a post-study survey. The results of the data analysis indicate that there is a statistically significant preference for non-sponsored links with searchers viewing these results first more than 82\% of the time. Searchers view sponsored links primarily as advertisements, appreciate these links if they are relevant, and are unconcerned if the search engines disclose them as sponsored links.

In particular, as the final states depend on the order in which the two actions are performed, we directly observed the noncommutativity of the creation and annihilation operators, one of the cardinal concepts of quantum mechanics, at the basis of the quantum behavior of light.

Here, we provide an approach to language evolution based on evolutionary game theory. We explore the ways in which protolanguages can evolve in a nonlinguistic society and how specific signals can become associated with specific objects. We assume that early in the evolution of language, errors in signaling and perception would be common. We model the probability of misunderstanding a signal and show that this limits the number of objects that can be described by a protolanguage. This 'error limit' is not overcome by employing more sounds but by combining a small set of more easily distinguishable sounds into words. The process of 'word formation' enables a language to encode an essentially unlimited number of objects. Next, we analyze how words can be combined into sentences and specify the conditions for the evolution of very simple grammatical rules. We argue that grammar originated as a simplified rule system that evolved by natural selection to reduce mistakes in communication. Our theory provides a systematic approach for thinking about the origin and evolution of human language.},

We obtain the theoretical lower bound on the uncertainty in the estimate of the parameter. For arbitrary initial states, the lower bound scales as 1/nk, and for initial product states, it scales as 1/nk\&minus;1/2. We show that the latter scaling can be achieved using simple, separable measurements. We analyze in detail the case of a quadratic Hamiltonian (k=2), implementable with Bose-Einstein condensates. We formulate a simple model, based on the evolution of angular-momentum coherent states, which explains the O(n\&minus;3/2) scaling for k=2; the model shows that the entanglement generated by the quadratic Hamiltonian does not play a role in the enhanced sensitivity scaling. We show that phase decoherence does not affect the O(n\&minus;3/2) sensitivity scaling for initial product states.},

	abstract = {Background: The Western Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human TBE cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new TBE foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain TBE upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of TBE in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where TBE has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical TBE cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in TBE incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer. Conclusion/Significance: Substantial changes in vegetation structure that improve habitat suitability for the main TBE reservoir hosts (small mammals), as well as an increase in roe deer abundance due to changes in land and wildlife management practices, are likely to be among the most crucial factors affecting the circulation potential of Western TBE virus and, consequently, the risk of TBE emergence in humans in western Europe. We believe our approach will be useful in predicting TBE risk on a wider scale.},

	abstract = {We have studied the effect of the adsorption of milk proteins at the oil-water interface on their digestibility in simulated gastrointestinal environment. The investigations aimed to characterize how both the breakdown of the adsorbed proteins and the interactions with physiological surfactants, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and bile salts (BS), influence structural transformations of model, protein-stabilized food emulsions in the gastrointestinal track.Proteolysis of two contrasting proteins, [small beta]-casein ([small beta]-Cas) and [small beta]-lactoglobulin ([small beta]-Lg), was compared between the protein presented in solution or in emulsion, after adsorption at the oil-water interface. Digestion of [small beta]-Cas was faster when presented as an emulsion and led to the persistence of a 6 kD peptide not seen when the protein was presented in solution. Adsorption gave rise to a pepsin-susceptible form of [small beta]-Lg. Complex interactions were observed with PC introduced to the system in the vesicular form. Measurements of interfacial tension revealed that PC displaced the proteins from the oil droplets after only 30 s for [small beta]-Lg and 12 min for [small beta]-Cas, so that the gastric digestion largely took place in solution. Pepsinolysis of adsorbed [small beta]-Cas played a dominant role in emulsion destabilization. In contrast, collapse of [small beta]-Lg-stabilized emulsion under gastric conditions was mainly dependent on protein-PC interactions. [small beta]-Lg was significantly protected through simulated duodenal digestion as a result of a complex formed with the PC. In the absence of PC, the proteins were completely broken down after duodenal digestion, during which the duodenal surfactants, BS, displaced any remaining protein from the interface and governed the final structure of emulsion.},

	abstract = {The ability to utilize dinitrogen as a nitrogen source is an important phenotypic trait in most currently known methanotrophic bacteria (MB). This trait is especially important for acidophilic MB, which inhabit acidic oligotrophic environments, highly depleted in available nitrogen compounds. Phylogenetically, acidophilic MB are most closely related to heterotrophic dinitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Beijerinckia. To further explore the phylogenetic linkage between these metabolically different organisms, the sequences of nifH and nifD gene fragments from acidophilic MB of the genera Methylocella and Methylocapsa, and from representatives of Beijerinckia, were determined. For reference, nifH and nifD sequences were also obtained from some type II MB of the alphaproteobacterial Methylosinus/Methylocystis group and from gammaproteobacterial type I MB. The trees constructed for the inferred amino acid sequences of nifH and nifD were highly congruent. The phylogenetic relationships among MB in the NifH and NifD trees also agreed well with the corresponding 16S rRNA-based phylogeny, except for two distinctive features. First, different methods used for phylogenetic analysis grouped the NifH and NifD sequences of strains of the gammaproteobacterial MB Methylococcus capsulatus within a clade mainly characterized by Alphaproteobacteria, including acidophilic MB and type II MB of the Methylosinus/Methylocystis group. From this and other genomic data from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, it is proposed that an ancient event of lateral gene transfer was responsible for this aberrant branching. Second, the identity values of NifH and NifD sequences between Methylocapsa acidiphila B2 and representatives of Beijerinckia were clearly higher (98{middle dot}5 and 96{middle dot}6 \%, respectively) than would be expected from their 16S rRNA-based relationships. Possibly, these two bacteria originated from a common acidophilic dinitrogen-fixing ancestor, and were subject to similar evolutionary pressure with regard to nitrogen acquisition. This interpretation is corroborated by the observation that, in contrast to most other diazotrophs, M. acidiphila B2 and Beijerinckia spp. are capable of active growth on nitrogen-free media under fully aerobic conditions. 10.1099/mic.0.26585-0},

However, no sequences are available for nif genes in these strains, and the known nitrogen-fixing methanotrophs are confined mainly to a few genera. The purpose of this work was to assess the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of a variety of methanotroph strains. nifH gene fragments from four type I methanotrophs and seven type II methanotrophs were PCR amplified and sequenced. Nitrogenase activity was confirmed in selected type I and type II strains by acetylene reduction. Activities ranged from 0.4 to 3.3 nmol/min/mg of protein. Sequence analysis shows that the nifH sequences from the type I and type II strains cluster with nifH sequences from other gamma proteobacteria and alpha proteobacteria, respectively. The translated nifH sequences from three Methylomonas strains show high identity (95 to 99\%) to several published translated environmental nifH sequences PCR amplified from rice roots and a freshwater lake. The translated nifH sequences from the type II strains show high identity (94 to 99\%) to published translated nifH sequences from a variety of environments, including rice roots, a freshwater lake, an oligotrophic ocean, and forest soil. These results provide evidence for nitrogen fixation in a broad range of methanotrophs and suggest that nitrogen-fixing methanotrophs may be widespread and important in the nitrogen cycling of many environments. 10.1128/AEM.67.9.4009-4016.2001},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme activities in FM with respect to their importance in pathogenesis, and the relationship with FM-related clinical parameters.Methods.  After obtaining informed consent, 25 female FM patients were compared with 23 healthy female controls. NOS and arginase enzyme activities were measured spectrophometrically in sera. Tender points were examined using the protocol described by Wolfe et al. The health status of patients was assessed by Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Musculoskeletal pain was scored according to visual analog scale. Health Assessment Questionnaire, Beck depression and Beck anxiety scales, and dyspnea scores were administered to analyze functional, psychiatric, and respiratory status of the patients.Results.  We found that NOS activity was significantly higher whereas arginase activity was lower in patients with FM. In the correlation analysis, NOS levels showed statistically significant positive correlation with chest pain and dyspnea parameters. NOS enzyme activities were higher in subjects with positive history of migraine, pain, and morning stiffness. On the other hand, arginase levels were lower in subjects with positive history of irritable bowel syndrome and morning stiffness.Conclusion.  Animal experiments have suggested that nitric oxide (NO) is an important transmitter in pain pathways. It can also stimulate cyclooxygenase activity. We observed increased NOS activity and reduced arginase activity in FM patients, which may be due to increased cyclooxygenase enzyme activity and oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. In conclusion, we think that future studies concerning clinical control of pain with selective NOS inhibitors are needed in order to determine new therapeutic approaches and the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms in FM patients.},

This article argues that new mediated communication channels merit detailed sociological analysis, and that interactional differences between media have been overlooked. Goffman explicitly restricted his interaction order to face-to-face interaction.The article adapts some of Goffman's interactional concepts for synchronous mediated interaction, but argues that his situational focus is less relevant to asynchronous media. The theoretical approach developed is illustrated and supported by qualitative research on mobile phones, which fortuitously afford both synchronous and asynchronous communication.The study suggests that although the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous interaction is important, it is not technologically determined, but shaped by interactional norms. 10.1177/0038038509103197},

Investigated are the interfacial tension; the order parameter; the susceptibility; and the coexistence diameter. Our results clearly show that the interfacial tension vanishes at the critical point with exponent 2ν≈1.26. This is in good agreement with the 3D Ising exponent. Also calculated are critical amplitude ratios; which are shown to be compatible with the corresponding 3D Ising values. We additionally identify a number of subtleties that are encountered when finite size scaling is applied to the AO model. In particular; we find that close to the critical point; the finite size extrapolation of the interfacial tension is most consistent when logarithmic size dependences are ignored.},

@article{citeulike:3123815,
	abstract = {To investigate whether the expression of visual extinction is dependent upon the contralesional low saliency existing in neglect, we tested stroke patients with neglect and extinction, as well as normal controls, on detection of a peripheral Gabor patch, while a competing patch was presented simultaneously on the other side. To compensate for uneven saliency we set the contrast level relative to the detection threshold on each side. Patients showed contralesional extinction even for stimuli set at threshold level. They differed from controls in their sensitivity to changes in relative contrast between sides, showing stronger tendency for extinction and requiring much higher contrast increments in the target patch in order to eliminate extinction. The differences between normal and pathological extinction, shown despite compensation for contralesional perceptual attenuation due to neglect, suggest an additional extinction-specific deficit related to an abnormal interplay between the bilaterally presented stimuli. These findings have important theoretical implications concerning the relationship between neglect and extinction. They demonstrate that the hypothetical [`]attentional gradient', taken to explain reduced saliency of stimuli in the neglected side, cannot fully account for the phenomenon of extinction.},

@article{citeulike:4867265,
	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks that operate on batteries have limited network lifetime. There have been extensive recent research efforts on how to design protocols and algorithms to prolong network lifetime. However, due to energy constraint, even under the most efficient protocols and algorithms, the network lifetime may still be unable to meet the mission's requirements. In this paper, we consider the energy provisioning (EP) problem for a two-tiered wireless sensor network. In addition to provisioning additional energy on the existing nodes, we also consider deploying relay nodes (RNs) into the network to mitigate network geometric deficiencies and prolong network lifetime. We formulate the joint problem of EP and RN placement (EP-RNP) into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since an MINLP problem is NP-hard in general, and even state-of-the-art software and techniques are unable to offer satisfactory solutions, we develop a heuristic algorithm, called Smart Pairing and INtelligent Disc Search (SPINDS), to address this problem. We show a number of novel algorithmic design techniques in the design of SPINDS that effectively transform a complex MINLP problem into a linear programming (LP) problem without losing critical points in its search space. Through numerical results, we show that SPINDS offers a very attractive solution and some important insights to the EP-RNP problem.},

	abstract = {Abstract.   A robust classification scheme for partitioning water chemistry samples into homogeneous groups is an important tool for the characterization of hydrologic systems. In this paper we test the performance of the many available graphical and statistical methodologies used to classify water samples including: Collins bar diagram, pie diagram, Stiff pattern diagram, Schoeller plot, Piper diagram, Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis, K-means clustering, principal components analysis, and fuzzy k-means clustering. All the methods are discussed and compared as to their ability to cluster, ease of use, and ease of interpretation. In addition, several issues related to data preparation, database editing, data-gap filling, data screening, and data quality assurance are discussed and a database construction methodology is presented. The use of graphical techniques proved to have limitations compared with the multivariate methods for large data sets. Principal components analysis is useful for data reduction and to assess the continuity/overlap of clusters or clustering/similarities in the data. The most efficient grouping was achieved by statistical clustering techniques. However, these techniques do not provide information on the chemistry of the statistical groups. The combination of graphical and statistical techniques provides a consistent and objective means to classify large numbers of samples while retaining the ease of classic graphical presentations.},

A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.},

	abstract = {The apparent solubilities of schwertmannite and ferrihydrite were estimated from the H + , OH − , Fe 3+ , and SO 4 2−  activities of the natural stream waters in Korea and mine drainage in Ohio, USA. Both chemical composition of the stream waters and the mineralogy of the precipitates were determined for samples from two streams polluted by coal mine drainage. This study combines these new results with previous data from Ohio, USA to redetermine solubilities. The activities of the dissolved species necessary for the solubility determinations were calculated from the chemical compositions of the waters with the WATEQ4F computer code. Laboratory analyses of precipitates indicated that the main minerals present in Imgok and Osheep creek were schwertmannite and ferrihydrite, respectively. The schwertmannite from Imgok creek had a variable chemical formula of Fe 8 O 8 (OH) 8−2 x (SO 4 ) x ·  n H 2 O, where 1.74 ≤  x  ≤ 1.86 and 8.17 ≤  n  ≤ 8.62. The chemical formula of ferrihydrite was Fe 2 O 3 · 1.6H 2 O. With known mineralogy of the precipitates from each stream, the activities of H + , OH − , Fe 3+ , and SO 4 2−  in the waters were plotted on logarithmic activity-activity diagrams to determine apparent solubilities of schwertmannite and ferrihydrite. The best estimate for the logarithm of the solubility product of schwertmannite, logK s , was 10.5 ± 2.5 around 15°C. This value of logK s  constrains the logarithm of the solubility product of ferrihydrite, logK f , to be 4.3 ± 0.5 to maintain the stability boundary with schwertmannite observed in natural waters.},

Both morphological observation and biochemical analysis revealed that H 2 O 2 /FeSO 4 treatment induced apoptotic cell death in cerebellar granule cells, which was characterized by chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. During this process, the fluidity of the cell membrane decreased markedly, and the conformation of membrane proteins altered significantly. Pretreating cerebellar granule cells with the antioxidant EGb761 (Ginkgo biloba extract) effectively attenuated oxidative damage induced by H 2 O 2 /FeSO 4 , and prevented cells from apoptotic cell death.

	abstract = {Several human diseases have been associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently various antioxidants emerged as potential therapeutic agents that scavenge ROS. As an oxidative stress model of human disease, we used hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to study effect of ROS on C6 glioma cells as a surrogate for astrocytes. H 2 O 2  induced dose- and time-dependent apoptotic cell death which was preceded by growth arrest, and transiently activated the signalling proteins ATF-2, ERK1/2 and AKT in C6 glioma cells. While several antioxidants failed to block H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis of these cells,  Ginkgo biloba  extract (EGb) totally prevented the cell death and growth inhibition induced by H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, EGb did not prevent the activation of ATF-2, ERK1/2 and AKT induced by H 2 O 2  excluding the role of these factors in the pro-apoptotic effect of H 2 O 2 . We have previously shown that the lipid-lowering drug, simvastatin, causes apoptotic cell death in C6 glioma cells [Koyuturk M, Ersoz M, Altiok N. Simvastatin induces proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in C6 glioma cells via c-jun N-terminal kinase. Neurosci Lett 2004;370(2–3):212–7]. However, in parallel experiments with H 2 O 2 , EGb was unable to prevent cell death induced by simvastatin suggesting the involvement of separate signalling pathways between H 2 O 2  and simvastatin. Thus, EGb and other plant flavonoids might have potential as protective agents against apoptosis through scavenging ROS upon cerebral or myocardial diseases associated with free radical generation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two previously unreported thyrotropin (TSH) receptor mutations, A623F and I635V, were identified in toxic follicular thyroid adenoma specimens from two patients with hyperthyroidism. Our aim was to characterize both novel mutants in terms of the following: cAMP basal constitutive activity, cAMP response to TSH, plasma membrane expression levels, and TSH binding properties. METHODS: We performed DNA extraction for TSHR gene sequencing. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and mutated TSH receptor constructs for determination of basal cAMP constitutive activity and dose-response accumulation of cAMP using recombinant human TSH. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to evaluate plasma membrane expression. Binding studies using bovine TSH as a ligand were performed to compare the affinities of wild-type and mutated TSH receptors for TSH. RESULTS: Both mutants, A623F and I635V, had higher cAMP basal constitutive activities than the wild-type TSH receptor. A623F but not I635V showed lower plasma membrane expression than the wild-type receptor. IC50, an indirect measurement of ligand-receptor affinity, was lower in A623F and higher in I635V than in the wild-type TSH receptor, although no statistically significant differences were observed. No differences were observed in EC50 and although the absolute values of maximal stimulation achieved with both mutants were higher than the wild type, the differences did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: A623F and I635V are two naturally occurring TSH receptor mutations that increase basal cAMP accumulation and consequently promote the development of toxic follicular thyroid adenoma. cAMP response to increasing TSH dose is retained by A623F and I635V mutated receptors and the maximal stimulation obtained is not different from that of the wild-type receptor. Substitution of alanine 623 by phenylalanine 623 at the third intracellular loop of the TSH receptor decreases its plasma membrane expression, indicating that alanine 623 is important in directing the TSH receptor to the cell surface or in down-regulating the constitutive receptor. By contrast, isoleucine 635, located in the sixth transmembrane domain, is important in regulating TSH receptor basal activity but does not modify its plasma membrane expression.},

Our approach is similar to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation in quantum mechanics and follows from the stochastic path integral representation of the cumulant generating function of reaction events. In applications with a small number of chemical reactions, it produces analytical expressions for cumulants of chemical fluxes between the slow variables. This allows for a low-dimensional, interpretable representation and can be used for high-accuracy, low-complexity coarse-grained numerical simulations. As an example, we derive the coarse-grained description for a chain of biochemical reactions and show that the coarse-grained and the microscopic simulations agree, but the former is 3 orders of magnitude faster.},

The Internet-based resource often acts as a virtual healthcare professional. The effectiveness of the communication between the patient and the virtual healthcare professional depends partly upon the presence of contextual information. The issue here is to what extent the contextualization of information is needed for effective information seeking and for the person's understanding of the retrieved/received information. The impact of contextualization on information search also closely relates to the person's cognitive resources. Using a theoretical communication framework (Te'eni 2001), we explore contextualization in a health website, and discuss the above issues and the possible relevance of contextualized information on the informed patient.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the drive towards cost-effectiveness and efficiency, coupled with radical changes in healthcare education, have resulted in an increased need for collaboration, both at the interpersonal and institutional levels. Such collaborations were once regarded primarily as pragmatic ventures. Increasingly, however, there are reports of these collaborations yielding tangible benefits, both in terms of curriculum innovation and reconceptualization of the educational process.  This paper draws upon some recent examples from the literature to examine the nature of collaborative partnerships in healthcare education. In particular, it discusses the development of collaborative practices and identifies diverse contexts (such as the sharing of resources and the integration of computer technologies in the curriculum) in which these practices evolve. This paper brings to the front changes that are triggered by collaborative initiatives, and highlights lessons learned for successful collaborations. 10.1177/146045820100700302},

The activity of these neurons may signal a prediction of postsaccadic visual input, derived from an efference copy of saccadic motor output. Such a prediction is often thought to underlie our perception of a stable visual world, by compensating for the shifts in retinal image that accompany each eye movement. Here we review the evidence, and conclude that prediction does not in fact play a significant role in maintaining visual stability. Instead, we consider a novel perspective in which the primary function of spatial remapping is to support three key nonperceptual processes: action control, sensorimotor adaptation and spatial memory.},

Next, they address the problems of theory and conceptual framework for individual-based ecology: What is "theory"? That is, how do we develop reusable models of how system dynamics arise from characteristics of individuals? What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies? An extensive review illustrates the ecological problems that have been addressed with individual-based models. The authors then identify how the mechanics of building and using individual-based models differ from those of traditional science, and provide guidance on formulating, programming, and analyzing models.

	abstract = {Organisations often appear to be unaware of fundamental differences that exist between their organisational context and that which is assumed by ERP package developers. This has undermined expected benefits from ERP implementation, and in extreme cases of package-organisational misalignment, has led to project and even organisational failure. In this study, we explain package-organisational misalignments as the result of differences between the structures embedded in the package and those embedded in the organisation. These differences reflect the different institutional context of the package developers and implementing organisation. Some organisational structures are imposed while other structures are voluntarily adopted. The organisation has less control in the case of imposed structures and misalignments associated with imposed structures are therefore more likely to be resolved through package customization. We apply the framework to three hospitals implementing the same ERP package, identify the structural sources of the misalignments, and analyze the relationship to the type of resolution (package customization or organisational adaptation). We found that imposed structures were indeed overwhelmingly resolved through package customization, while most voluntarily acquired structures were resolved via organisational adaptation. We identified the different context specific sources for these structural differences and contribute to the research on ERP implementation, institutional theory, as well as draw implications for practice in managing package–organisation misalignments.},

The significance of host deleterious mutations when hosts and parasites antagonistically coevolve (reciprocal evolution of host resistance and parasite infectivity) has not previously been experimentally investigated. We addressed this by coevolving the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a parasitic bacteriophage in laboratory microcosms, using bacteria with high and low mutation loads. Directional coevolution between bacterial resistance and phage infectivity occurred in all populations. Bacterial population fitness, as measured by competition experiments with ancestral genotypes in the absence of phage, declined with time spent coevolving. However, this decline was significantly more rapid in bacteria with high mutation loads, suggesting the cost of bacterial resistance to phage was greater in the presence of deleterious mutations (synergistic epistasis). As such, resistance to phage was more costly to evolve in the presence of a high mutation load. Consistent with these data, bacteria with high mutation loads underwent less rapid directional coevolution with their phage populations, and showed lower levels of resistance to their coevolving phage populations. These data suggest that coevolution with parasites increases the rate at which deleterious mutations are purged from host populations.},

Most important, boundary extension was evident when only a 42-ms mask separated the original and test views. Experiments 1 and 3 included conditions eliciting a gaze shift prior to the rating test; this did not eliminate boundary extension.

	abstract = {For studying why cells of  At. ferrooxidans  A2 attach to given locations on pyrite surfaces, a newly developed combination of atomic force and epifluorescence microscopy (AFM and EFM, respectively) was used. Attached bacterial cells were visualized under various conditions and stained concomitantly with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) and the isothiocyanate-labeled lectin concanavalin A (FITC-ConA). By comparing AFM images generated by contact mode in air or intermittent contact mode in mineral salt solution, significant differences were observed. Most strikingly, images acquired in fluid showed smoother surfaces with little surface detail. Although bacterial cell width and length did not vary either by using contact mode in air or intermittent contact mode in mineral salt solution scans, cell height imaged in air were 30 ± 10\% below those imaged in fluid, indicating dehydration under this condition. Extracellular polysaccharides of attached cells were successfully stained with FITC-ConA. Evaluation of the corresponding AFM images confirmed that the cell integrity was not affected by the DAPI and lectin staining. In the future, the novel microscopic technique could also be used for testing other lectins and staining methods. Hence, the high spatial resolution of AFM imaging in combination with specific staining and possibly also quantification of EPS and other cell components under in situ conditions could be achieved.},

	abstract = {Anholonomies in the parametric dependences of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of Floquet operators that describe unit time evolutions of periodically driven systems, e.g., kicked rotors, are studied. First, an example of the anholonomies induced by a periodically pulsed rank-1 perturbation is given. As a function of the strength of the perturbation, the perturbed Floquet operator of the quantum map and its spectrum are shown to have a period. However, we show examples where each eigenvalue does not obey the periodicity of the perturbed Floquet operator and exhibits an anholonomy. Furthermore, this induces another anholonomy in the eigenspaces, i.e., the directions of the eigenvectors, of the Floquet operator. These two anholonomies are previously observed in a family of Hamiltonians [T. Cheon, Phys. Lett. A 248, 285 (1998)] and are different from the phase anholonomy known as geometric phases. Second, the stability of Cheon's anholonomies in periodically driven systems is established by a geometrical analysis of the family of Floquet operators. Accordingly, Cheon's anholonomies are expected to be abundant in systems whose time evolutions are described by Floquet operators. As an application, a design principle for quantum state manipulations along adiabatic passages is explained.},

@article{citeulike:4866978,
	abstract = {A new method of cloaking is presented. For two-dimensional quasistatics it is
proven how a single active exterior cloaking device can be used to shield an
object from surrounding fields, yet produce very small scattered fields. The
problem is reduced to finding a polynomial which is approximately one within
one disk and zero within a second disk, and such a polynomial is constructed.
For the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation, it is numerically shown that three
active exterior devices placed around the object suffice to produce very good
cloaking.},

@article{citeulike:4866237,
	abstract = {The interplay between chaotic tunnelling and dynamical localization in mixed phase space is investigated. Semiclassical analysis using complex classical orbits reveals that tunnelling through torus regions and transport in chaotic regions are not independent processes, rather they are strongly correlated and described by complex orbits with both properties. This predicts a phenomenon analogous to the quantum suppression of classical diffusion: chaotic tunnelling is suppressed as a result of dynamical localization in chaotic regions. This hypothesis is confirmed by numerical experiments where the effect of destructive interference is attenuated.},

@article{citeulike:4866928,
	abstract = {Scene memory frequently includes a swath of unseen layout beyond a photograph's boundaries (boundary extension [BE]; Intraub and Richardson, 1989). Might it be affected by the viewer's plan to shift fixation near a view boundary? When photographs were centrally fixated (500 msec), BE occurred following a 2-sec masked interval (Experiment 1). In Experiments 2-4, a cue during the first fixation signaled viewers to fixate an object near the left or right boundary. The picture was masked before the eyes landed. BE occurred on the cued side and on the top and bottom, but not on the uncued side. This relatively accurate performance on the uncued side suggests that inhibition of a movement to one side (in a competitive task) may also inhibit extrapolation of layout. BE on the to-be-fixated side, however, supports the idea that anticipatory representation of layout is an adaptive error that may aid the spatial integration of successive views.},
